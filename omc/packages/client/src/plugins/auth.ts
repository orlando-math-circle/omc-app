/**
 * Plugin: Auth Handler
 *
 * As this website utilizes server-side rendering (SSR) cookie
 * management has special considerations.
 *
 * Data is retrieved on the server by accessing cookies sent from the
 * user's browser in the initial request. If the cookies are used to successfully
 * retrieve user data on the API then the token is saved in the `AuthStore`.
 * Since stores are sent as part of the pre-hydrated data back to the client,
 * the token can then be used to make authenticated requests as bearer tokens.
 *
 * This plugin will run twice â€” on the server and client. This is beneficial
 * because unlike the stores, Axios will not transfer the token from server to client
 * during hydration and needs to be set using the token found in the store.
