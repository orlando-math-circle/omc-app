5. <badge style="margin: 0">Install</badge> Download the codebase and install the npm dependencies.
6. <badge style="margin: 0">Install</badge> Bootstrap the database.

## Environment & Tooling

Complete steps `1` through `3` of the requirements by visiting the [environment guide](/tools/environment) to obtain the following:

- Node.js `14.X.X` installation.
- Yarn
- Git or GitHub compatible Git client.
- Visual Studio Code with the [recommended extensions](/tools/environment#extensions).
- Insomnia or similar endpoint testing client.
- Docker and Docker Compose or other PostgreSQL credentials.
- DataGrip or other database management tool.

## Downloading & Install

In this step the application will be downloaded and the `npm` dependencies installed.

1.  Download the repository using Git. This will make a folder called `omc`, though you may change it.

    <code-group>
      <code-block label="SSH" active>

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:orlando-math-circle/omc-app.git omc
    ```

      </code-block>
      <code-block label="HTTPS">

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/orlando-math-circle/omc-app.git omc
    ```

      </code-block>
    </code-group>

2.  Install the dependencies for the application. This may take a while as it will install dependencies for all of the packages in the repository.

    ```bash
    cd omc && yarn
    ```

3.  Copy the default avatars and event picture to the static directory.

    ```bash
    cp -R ./packages/shared/src/images ../uploads
    ```

    You should end up with an `uploads` folder at the same level as the `omc` folder.

When managing packages be aware that `yarn add` and `yarn remove` depend on the directory you're in. From the `omc` folder you can target a different package workspace with `yarn workspace @omc/client <add/remove>` with the workspaces being `@omc/client`, `@omc/server`, `@omc/docs`, and `@omc/shared`. There are shortcuts added to the `package.json` allowing yarn to manage workspaces as shortcuts, e.g. `yarn server <add/remove>`.

## Services

The three external services â€” `PayPal`, `MailerSend`, and `Twitter` need to be configured to initialize the application in a development mode. Acquire access to the credentials for each and save them as described in the following [configuration](/installation/development#configuration) section.

- **PayPal** credentials need to be configured or the application will not start. Visit the [PayPal services setup](/installation/services#paypal) guide for obtaining credentials.
- **Twitter** has a lengthy application process for obtaining credentials described in the [Twitter service setup](/installation/services#twitter) guide. The previous team has a Twitter account approved for the application already and can provide the credentials to you.
- **SendGrid** has multiple development options described in the [MailerSend service setup](/installation/services#mailersend). In sandbox mode, emails are printed to the console.

<alert type="warning">

You may enter anything to bypass the `TWITTER_KEY` and `TWITTER_SECRET` requirement and the rest of the application will work, just not load any tweets.

</alert>

## Configuration

Each package in the `packages` directory can be configured with a `.env` file. For a list of available environment variables you can visit the [configuration](/installation/configuration) page. Not many will need to be provided in a development environment as there are defaults that can be used locally.

<alert type="info">

Some operating systems do not show file extensions by default. This can make working with a `.env` file annoying.

- [Show filename extensions on Mac](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#rules)
- [Show filename extensions on Windows](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/show-file-extensions-in-windows)

</alert>

1. Create a file named `.env` in the `./packages/server` folder and fill it with the required variables.

   ```bash
   # From the PayPal Developer Portal
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=
   PAYPAL_SECRET_KEY=
   # Twitter Developer Portal
   TWITTER_KEY=
   TWITTER_SECRET=
   # SendGrid Dashboard
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=
   ```

   <alert type="info">

   All variables within a `.env` file are strings. There is no need to add quotations.

   ```bash
   # For example
   SECRET=OMC19456!@^&
   ```

   </alert>

2. Create another `.env` file in the `./packages/client` folder. However, the client server will operate on the default configuration and thus the file can be left empty.

## Database Setup

The application requires a single PostgreSQL database to operate. If you are using Docker you may continue along with this section. Otherwise, fill in the settings starting with `DATABASE_` found on the [configuration](/installation/development#configuration) for the server.

1. Open your terminal and point it to the root directory of the project containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. Run the following command and wait for Docker to finish initializing the PostgreSQL database.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Open DataGrip and click on the `+` sign then go to `Data Source` and select `PostgreSQL` and enter the following connection information.

   | Option           | Value             |
   | ---------------- | ----------------- |
   | `Host`           | `localhost`       |
   | `Port`           | `5432`            |
   | `Authentication` | `User & Password` |
   | `User`           | `postgres`        |
   | `Password`       | `postgres`        |
   | `Database`       | `postgres`        |

4. Click on `Test Connection` and a green checkmark should indicate the connection was successful.

   <img src="/omc-app/images/installation/connection.png" />

5. Navigate to the `Schemas` tab on the toolbar above `Host` and click on `All databases`. This tells DataGrip to care about any new database we may create.

   <img src="/omc-app/images/installation/schemas.png" />

6. Name the connection anything you would like, then hit `OK` to save and close it.

7. On the left sidebar expand the connection you created and right click on `databases` and in the `New` submenu select `New Database`.

   <img src="/omc-app/images/installation/create-db.png" />

8. Name the database `omc` then lick `OK` and exit DataGrip once the new database is created.

   You can rename the database, say for other testing environments, but the `DATABASE_NAME` environment variable will need to be configured.

9. Go back to the terminal in the root of the project and run the following command to create the database schema.

   <code-group>
     <code-block label="Docker" active>

   ```bash
   yarn server mikro-orm schema:create -r
   ```

     </code-block>
     <code-block label="Remote">

   ```bash
   # Use if you are connecting to an external database, e.g. Azure
   yarn server mikro-orm schema:create -r --fk-checks
   ```

     </code-block>
   </code-group>

## Initialization

Now that we have the source code, dependencies, and the database the application can be started.

1. In the application folder run the following command.

   ```build
   yarn server dev
   ```

2. Open a second terminal in the same directory and enter the following command.

   ```build
   yarn client dev
   ```

3. The server will now be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the application at `http://localhost:9000`.

<alert type="warning">

The development build of the client can take a considerable amount of time as it initially turns on. It may appear to hang but it is still working.
