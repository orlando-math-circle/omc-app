## MailerSend

### Templating vs. HTML

A critical feature of sending emails, especially transactional emails, is the ability to personalize them for the receiver. This can be as simple as a greeting with their name in it, or a transactional email link containing a unique token to confirm some action.

The easiest way of going about this is through a templating engine. Templating in this context takes static template files with variables in them that are replaced at runtime. A rudimentary example of this is commonly used in JavaScript template literals, though template engines have more features and differing syntaxes.

```JavaScript
const first = 'Jane';
const last = 'Doe';

const name = `Hello ${first} ${last}!`;

console.log(name) // Hello Jane Doe!
```

This could be accomplished on the server using [template strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), `string.replace()`, or a library dedicated to templating. However, MailerSend providing this feature means the server doesn't have to expend any computational power on recreating the wheel. Templates also allow for specifying default data for the email `subject`, `from email`, `from name`, and auto-generating a text version of the email.
