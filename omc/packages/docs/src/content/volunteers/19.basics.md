The following sections are dedicated to providing extensive resources and tutorials pertaining to the technologies used in the OMC application. As every student has a different level of expertise with the following tools and languages, students are free to skip around to the technologies they are less familiar with and learn at their own pace.

## GitHub

GitHub is the hosting platform the developer teams use for version control and collaboration. Orlando Math Circle has set up an Organization where developers are able to make contributions to the application's code from their personal GitHub accounts. For students looking to pursue a degree in Computer Science or just continue coding as a hobby, GitHub accounts are excellent for organizing multiple projects and presenting a portfolio to potential employers. Create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join).

> For detailed intructions and helpful tips on GitHub as it pertains to the OMC application, visit the [Git & GitHub guide](/tools/git). It is *recommended* to only visit the guide once you are familiar with the technologies covered following sections and ready to work with the application.

## IDEs

Integrated Development Environments, known as IDEs, are applications that encompass all the comprehensive resources needed to design and build software. Under many of the following sections are IDEs and online editors suggested by the development team for the students to gain hands on experience with the respective languages. All are free of charge and do not require account creation to use. The students will ultimately have the opportunity to work directly within the application's code and these IDEs will allow them to gain practice in a smaller-scale and less complicated setting.

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a popular IDE that supports hundreds of programming languages and offers advanced features for developers. Its user interface provides simplicity and offers hundreds of UI themes for customization. VSCode consists of a Marketplace with a wide range of extensions that can make programming faster, easier, and more engaging. 

One extension VSCode offers is a 'Live Share' feature that allows developers to share their code and environment with classmates, colleagues, and friends through a simple link. Live Share is a convenient form of collaboration that allows several people to work within the same workspace without invitees needing to configure the same tools, extensions, dependencies, etc. required to run the code.

Another great feature of VSCode is its integrated terminal. Compared to other IDEs with toolbar buttons designed to compile and run code, this integrated terminal utilizes command-line tools. Becoming familiar with the terminal is great for students wanting to gain experience with Command Line and Unix commands, both a desirable skill by employers and a helpful skill in the world of web development and scripting. VSCode's [Integrated Terminal Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) covers advanced information about its terminal and relevant tasks.

Although VSCode is not needed for practice with the languages that are about to be introduced, it is a versatile IDE suggested for students who plan to continue coding. Download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

> For detailed instruction on how to download VSCode and relevant extensions, visit the [Visual Studio Code dev guide](/tools/environment#visual-studio-code). Again, it is *recommended* to visit this guide once you are prepared to work with the app.

## Markdown 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating websites, notes, presentations, technical documentation, and more. It is a formatting syntax designed to convert plain-text to structurally valid HTML and is widely used due to its easy-to-read and easy-to-write structure. The current documentation you are reading these words on is constructed through individual Markdown files and compiled through GitHub Pages. For students looking to continue the OMC documentation, Markdown is a simple language to pick up.

> [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) provides a detailed guide on Markdown's basic and extended syntax along with tools that support the language
