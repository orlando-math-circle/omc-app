The Senior Design 1 research concluded on pricing suggestions and noted in the document the possibility for non-profit discount and benefits that could disrupt those opinions. In terms of host applicability, the website will need a Linux server, PostgreSQL installation either on the server or managed, and some emailing provider that is usable for transactional emails.

I was not able to find the Azure features on Techsoup discussed below, but I did find the AWS credits. This may be because Microsoft controls the evaluation process from their end first.

## Amazon Web Services

AWS has a **Nonprofit Credit Program** that provides $2000 USD in AWS promotional credit each fiscal year. The credits do not roll over, however.

This is provided through Techsoup, however one of the immediate warnings is that "educational institutions" are not eligible. OMC is not legally an educational entity as far as I am aware, but considering that AWS has an **AWS Educate Program** they may deny OMC under some classificaton of intent.

If OMC were classified as an educational institution they could apply for AWS Educate, which provides benefits, though they are harder to assess at a glance.

## Google Cloud Compute

I was not able to find any compelling benefits for Google Cloud Compute in terms of credits or computational power for the app.

However, Google does provide [G Suite for Non-Profits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/offerings/apps-for-nonprofits/). This was noticed during our SD1 research however was ruled out because it is not really meant to handle transactional emails. My father has his own business and pays for the basic G Suite, which is really just a more professional version of Gmail and some storage.

The other features seem related to video chat, in which OMC uses Zoom, and admin related user management of the organization that seems less than useful if the rest of the features aren't as useful.

## Microsoft Azure

Microsoft seems to be almost tailored for OMC's needs in this regard. One of the pillars that they consider in their [eligibility requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/eligibility) are those "advancing education".

<!--prettier-ignore-start-->
A $3,500 yearly Azure credit is available. The credits can be used on all Azure services, which is enticing. Without progressing further into the process I am unable to find more information, however Techsoup is once again mentioned on their [faq](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/faq) page.

A more intricate analysis of Azure would be needed to determine types of systems that would be used. However, one notable difference is it appears that Azure has no emailing capabilities whatsoever.

We can utilize AWS SES and that would only accrue a couple of dollars every month or two, however it may be worth looking into a full-feature emailing system that supports transactional and newsletter style emails. Systems such as those often have valiable analytics for determining how many users actually engage with the emails. We ruled these out during our initial solutions exploration as they often cost $15+/mo, equaling the cost of the app itself.

Microsoft for non-profits also includes Microsoft 365 Business for free.

## For Students

For students interested in all of the free tech they can get their hands on, all three services are more or less the same. Each allow for a certain amount of free reign to use a little bit of all of their systems for 12 months. Google offers a free `f1-micro` server in its always-free tier, meaning you can utilize the small server beyond 12 months. However, AWS and Azure don't seem to mind you creating new accounts to "renew" your free tier.

In terms of overall features and real-world desirability, AWS is leading in that department. I have not encountered Azure or Google being mentioned much in my college classes or in my experience in online communities which are looking for Linux servers or web solutions. I know Google is popular for its machine learning capabilites, but Azure is much more obscure to me.

These services will want a payment method on file. So long as you stay within the free tier this should not be a problem, but these interfaces are often highly confusing. AWS is particularly obtuse with incredibly poor documentation. Opening the AWS panel instills a level of fear and imposter syndrome in me that makes me yearn for the grave. The sheer number of services warrants people to get certifications in using sites like AWS.

I have personally been victim (aka, I made a mistake) of exposing my master AWS API key for my account. This is particularly bad because the key allows for basically any and everything to be done. Within seconds the key was found and a ton of servers were spawned in my name, and a stern and scary lady had to launch this month-long inquest into reversing all of the damage and being generous enough to refund the costs of the incredibly expensive servers that were spawned; likely for crypto mining or some techy version of a demonic summoning circle to use processing power to summon long-forgotten Myspace account credentials, or something. Long story short, be careful and when in doubt reach out.

I also recommend looking into less confusing services aimed towards hobbyists, for example, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home). Heroku allows you to spin up _dynos_ that load on demand for free, so long as you don't go over your monthly limit. It's a great way to show off projects and deploy them without any headache.
