## `.env` Files

There should two `.env` files — `./omc/backend/.env` and `./omc/frontend/.env` assuming `omc` is the name of the project root folder.

Environment variables are all strings as key-value structures separated by an equal sign of the form `KEY=VALUE`. There are caveats to how the rules are parsed, so please read the [dotenv parsing rules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#rules).

### Example Format

```bash
PORT=3000
USE_RRULE_CACHE=true
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:800
```
