description: Deep-dive into the different configuration options of the application.
category: Installation
version: 1.0

The application is configured by two primary configuration files â€” `./omc/packages/server/.env` and `./omc/packages/client/.env` assuming `omc` is the name of the repository root folder.

The `.env` files contain environment variables as key-value strings separated by an equal sign of the form `KEY=VALUE`. There are caveats to how the rules are parsed, so please read the [dotenv parsing rules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#rules).

### Example Format

```bash
PORT=3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:800
```
