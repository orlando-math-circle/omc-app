This document describes the general process for event registrations. On the application events can be found from multiple sources and events are publicly visible regardless of the user's ability to register. The flow can begin once a user visits the page for a particular event.

1. The user visits an event page.
2. Retrieve the event and populate it with any existing registrations or invoices for all users on retrieving account.
