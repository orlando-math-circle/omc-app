These videos are a progression showing the basic concepts of the NuxtJS frontend in practice. As explained in <a href="tutorials/stack">stack</a> these are not requirements or meant to be implied as best practices. They are meant to help explain the thought process going into how the first team developed the application.

Unlike with the backend, the frontend is a lot more free-form in library usage. This leads to so many different patterns and styles for constructing components within the frontend that it is not possible to give any definitive recommendations. These videos cover the different styles and their pros and cons with this in mind.

## NuxtJS Part 1 - Basics

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6q6LqOLf394' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

This video gleans over a lot of basics such as [components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html), [props](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html), [slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#slot), [file system routing](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/features/file-system-routing), [data fetching](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/features/data-fetching), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/), and some [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).

## NuxtJS Part 2 - TBD

I'm currently consolidating some ideas for more structured tutorials. Topics that I feel important are more advanced data fetching, slot data binding, and TypeScript.
