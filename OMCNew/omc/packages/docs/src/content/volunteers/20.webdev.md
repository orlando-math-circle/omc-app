## Background Information

As its name implies, web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. Web development is typically divided up into frontend and backend development. Frontend development makes up the visual appeal of the website, handling the site's design, layout, and interactivity. Backend development handles the behind the scenes of the site where data and the server is stored. This subject will be further explored in a later section. Beginners to web development typically become familiar with HTML and CSS (frontend languages) before delving into the more complex languages involved in web & mobile applications as simple static websites do not require any work from the backend. 

## HTML

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard markup language that composes a web page. Web browsers take HTML elements to render and display text, images, and additional visual and audio content.

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/UB1O30fR-EE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

## CSS

While HTML is the skeleton for the content displayed on a website, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the style sheet language that allows such content to be more visually appealing. 
 
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfoY53QXEnI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

> Similarly, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) provides extensive examples of the CSS syntax and embedded code editors to allow programmers to customize styling and instantly view the output

## JavaScript

Although websites can be built from HTML and CSS alone, JavaScript introduces interactivity. It is a client-side programming language that transforms static sites to dynamic and interactives ones. Despite similar names, note that JavaScript and Java are not related. However, students with experience in Java, C, or Python may find JavaScript's syntax more familiar compared to HTML/CSS. 

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hdI2bqOjy3c' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

## Websites vs. Web Applications

The key difference between traditional websites and web applications is its interactivity. Websites are referred to as one-way informational feeds, where visitors can view displayed content but are unable to interact with the site. They are typically only built using HTML and CSS but may contain minimal JavaScript code from time to time. Websites are intended to be viewed by all types of visitors and are often made to establish a brand and reputation for a business. 

Web applications on the other hand are much more complex than static websites. Web apps consist of functional and interactive elements where the client can send and/or receive information from the server the app is run on. Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook are all examples of popular web applications. Unlike static websites, web apps are built using a collection of languages and software that work together in what is known as a web stack.

The next section will cover web stacks and begin to unveil the specific technologies used in the OMC application.
