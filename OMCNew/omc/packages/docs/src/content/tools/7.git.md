## Git Basics

An easily digestible guide for understanding the commands is [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) by Roger Dudler.

### Cloning

The command most users experience first is `clone`. It saves a repository from its provided url on your system, essentially it saves a _clone_ of the code on your system.

1. Visit a GitHub repository (e.g. [github.com/duckies/omc-app](https://github.com/orlando-math-circle/omc-app)) and find the green `Clone` button.

2. Copy the the link using your preferred means of authentication. If you are unsure the `HTTPS` option can be changed later, or you may read about the differences: [Which remote URL should I use?](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use).

   I personally use the SSH method as you can [add a SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases) to GitHub and it wont ask for your credentials during each commit.

3. Using this repository as an example, you would open a terminal and enter a command with this structure.

   ```bash
   # Remote URL is the url copied from GitHub
   # Folder (Optional) changes the name of the folder created,
   # the folder name is the repository name by default.
   git clone <Remote-URL> <folder?>

   # For example
   git clone https://github.com/orlando-math-circle/omc-app.git omc
   ```

### Tracking

Not all files are tracked, or should be tracked, by Git and sent to GitHub. For example, the `.env` file contains privileged information that should never be committed. The `.gitignore` file at the root of the repository describes which files and folders will not meant to be committed. The most common things excluded are secrets (`.env`), compiled code, temporary data, `node_modules`, error dumps, and logs.

To lean on the importance of this issue. I had accidentally committed an Amazon Web Services API key and within seconds the entire account was compromised. They had spun up as many expensive virtual machines as they could and started farming cryptocurrency. It took me a couple weeks talking with a support associate in email and over the phone to secure the account and have the server costs refunded. I had to agree to be more careful because the reputation of the AWS is damaged when harmful actions originate from their servers. Something as simple as accidentally leaking a SendGrid API key could have OMC barred from using their services in the future and permanently damaging the reputation of the `orlandomathcircle.org` domain if spam was sent from it.

### Staging

If a file is not being ignored by `.gitignore` it can be staged to include these changes in the next commit. Staging is the act of telling Git which changes to include.

- `git add <file-path(s)>` will stage a specific file or files' changes.
- `git add -A` stages all changes.
- `git add .` stages new files and modifications, but not file deletions.
- `git add -u` stages modifications and deletions, but not new files.

If you changed your mind before committing, you can unstage in a few different ways.

- `git reset <file-path(s)>` will unstage the files(s) provided.
- `git reset` or `git reset HEAD` will unstage all files. `HEAD` can be replaced with a commit or going back 3 commits for example, `HEAD~3`, or the commit SHA hash.
- `git reset --hard` or `get reset --hard HEAD` will unstage all files and undo all modifications since the last commit, or the commit specified.

VSCode makes staging and unstaging files much easier than fiddling with the terminal. It also allows you to stage individual line(s) of changes in a file.

### Commits

Once you have staged changes a commit can be made. There are a few common syntaxes, but the core feature of the commit commands is adding your message.

<alert type="info">

See the [conventional commits](/tools/git#conventional-commits) section to see how it's recommended to write commit messages.

</alert>

1. A commit with a small summary messages that you should try to keep no longer than 50 characters.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "<message>"
   ```

2. Adding the `-a` flag will also stage all modifications and deletions, but not new files.

   ```bash
   git commit -a -m "<message>"
   ```

3. When the `-m` argument is not provided a larger message can be provided for the commit. The first line, called the header, is the same line that would be used with the inline `-m` argument. Things like code snippets and further explanation can go after the summary message (the header). Lines below the first should try to be less than 70 characters long.

   > A good example of a full-form commit message can be found commonly from the MikroORM author's pull requests. [feat(core): allow querying by JSON properties](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm/pull/1384/commits/3114f2361aab27175c89a2d90cc4be9e3b5a8f36)

### Pushing

- Push any local commits to the remote server for the specified branch, such as `master` [which may be called `main` for you](https://github.com/github/renaming).

  ```bash
  git push origin <branch>
  ```

- You can also push using a default strategy. This should push all changes to all branches on `origin` by default, but can be configured.

  ```bash
  git push
  ```

- If you initialized the git repository on your computer and didn't clone it, you will need to add the remote address provided by GitHub.

  ```bash
  git remote add origin <server>
  ```

### Updating

Obtaining any new changes from the repository to your local device is important and should be done regularly. You will also not be able to push changes if there are changes that are not pulled.

- The changes can be fetched, or downloaded but not actually applying the commit changes. This can allow you to view any new changes before the modifications are applied.

  ```bash
  git fetch
  ```

  While the commits could be viewed with `git log` or similar, you checkout the changes to view the changes as seen on the remote branch.

  ```bash
  git checkout origin/master
  ```

* Fetching the changes and merging them into your local branches can be done by pulling.

  ```bash
  git pull
  ```

  This command calls fetch then chains with it a `git merge FETCH_HEAD`. You may want to `git pull --rebase` instead, see why at the end of the [merging](/tools/git#merging) section.

### Branching

In order to develop new features the production, or master, branch should be left isolated until the feature is completed in a different branch where it wont break things. Once the feature is complete, the branch should be merged into the main branch. This is a fundamental for allowing multiple developers to work on a project.

- Creating a new local branch is done by name.

  ```bash
  git checkout -b <feature_name>
  ```

- You can switch back to the master, or between other branches, with the checkout command.

  ```bash
  git checkout master
  ```

- Branches need to be pushed to the remote repository for others to see and also work on them.

  ```bash
  git push origin <branch>
  ```

* Once a feature is completed and merged into the master it can safely be deleted.

  To delete a branch locally.

  ```bash
  git branch -d <branch>
  ```

  Remote branches can be deleted on GitHub, or by specifying the origin.

  ```bash
  git push origin --delete <branch>
  ```

### Merging

There are multiple strategies and concepts involved in merging a completed feature into the master branch. These are three popular strategies which coincide with the merge buttons provided by GitHub in the interface, though merging can be done in other ways through the the CLI.

1. **Merging** brings the master and feature branches together using a new commit on the master as the merging point. This method is the most common, simplest to use, and retains the most information. This will use the `git merge --no-ff` (i.e. [true merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_true_merge)) and will always create a merge commit even if [fast forwarding](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge) would have been available.

   With this option if a merged feature needs to be reverted it is easiest to revert the commit where the branches met. Similarly, the original timeline and ownership of the changes will be preserved.

2. **Squashing** will _squash_ all of the commits into a single commit and add it to the master using [fast forwarding](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge). This is commonly desired as a single commit describing the feature is more digestible than sifting through individual branch commits bloating the history. Downsides to this approach include the loss of the individual commits, who authored them, and their specific changes. Similarly, continuing to work on a branch after this merge may lead to merge conflicts.

   <img src="/omc-app/images/tools/squash.png" />

3. **Rebasing** will rewrite history by replaying the feature commits at the head of the master branch. The changes made by commits, and who authored them, will persist, but the order and time when they were originally authored are lost. The rebased commits are then merged using [fast forwarding](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge).

   Rebasing is one of the more dangerous, albeit powerful, tools in Git. It is harmless to use the CLI `git rebase` on local branches, e.g. to combine local commits that have not been pushed to the remote branches yet.

#### What method do I choose?

If you are invested in understanding a more advanced workflow I recommend [Git - When to Merge vs. When to Rebase](https://www.derekgourlay.com/blog/git-when-to-merge-vs-when-to-rebase/) by Derek Gourlay. His _rule of thumb_ points seem to reflect what I find most popular in the web development community. All that matters at the end of the day is something agreed-upon by your team and doesn't negatively impact anyone else's development on the codebase.

- If you are not comfortable with Git I recommend regular merging. The only downside is reverting a regular merge is a little more effort and the commit history will be bloated.
- If a pattern is utilized where features are deleted after being merged to the master instead of continuously developed (i.e. not from a `dev` channel), squash and merge will likely be ideal unless you're a history buff.
- Rebasing is only recommended during `pulling` changes into feature branches so they can use `fast-forward` merges when the feature is completed _OR_ combining commits on local branches before pushing them to the remote.

## Conventional Commits

The initial repository _attempted_ to follow a commit strategy. Even someone not fully adopting a commit strategy can benefit from the the core principles. Some core concepts are writing descriptions in an imperative tone, e.g. `fix rrule generation across multiple months` instead of `fixed rrules being generated across multiple months`, using a consistent capitalization scheme (usually all lowercase), and withholding punctuation.

[Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are a popular standard that appends a type, and optionally, a scope in front of the commit description.

```bash
fix(backend): fix rrule generation across multiple months
```

Here `fix` is the type, others include `feat`, `chore` (dependency updates, licensing, ...etc), `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf` and `test`. The `backend` is a scope that denotes additional context, usually a specific component in larger applications. However, if you use the full-sized message body the some more recommendations apply.

- The first line should be the same as if it were an inline commit.
- An optional body can be provided with a blank line separating it from the first. It can consist of markup or text for an explanation of the changes. Library authors use these to explain how to use new features, and patch makers explain the methodology or workarounds needed.
- Lastly, an optional footer can be provided with one new line after the body. This area is for links or other associations such related issues.

```bash
fix(backend): fix rrule generation across multiple months

[optional body body after blank link]

[optional footer after blank line]
```
