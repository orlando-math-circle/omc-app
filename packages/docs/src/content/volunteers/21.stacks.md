This section will be divided into 2 parts. The first part will cover the basics of web stacks for the students new to the world of web development and the second part will delve into the specific technologies used in the stack for the OMC app.

## What are Web Stacks?

Web stacks, also known as tech and development stacks, are a collection of tools, libraries, and frameworks used to build and deploy an application. More specifically, theyâ€™re a bundle of software components that comprise an applicationâ€™s frontend, backend, and database, consisting of an operating system, a programming language, a database management system, and a web server at minimum. 

### Types of Stacks

There are several types of stacks available and choosing the right stack for a project may depend on its complexity, scalability, and overall functionality. Common web stacks are listed and described as follows:

- **LAMP**: **L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, **P**HP
  - One of the most common stacks used to deliver web applications
  - MySQL is a relational database where data is structured in the form of tables, columns, and rows
- **MERN/MEAN/MEVN**: **M**ongoDB, **E**xpress, **R**eact/**A**ngular/**V**ue, **N**ode
  - Entirely JavaScript based
  - Several frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) work well with the backend technologies, making these stacks increasingly popular choices
  - MongoDB is a non-relational database where data is stored as documents in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format
- **Ruby on Rails**: 
  - All-inclusive web app framework using Ruby as the language and Rails as the framework
- **PEVN**: **P**ostgreSQL, **E**xpress, **V**ue, **N**ode
  - A glance into the stack used for the OMC app ðŸ‘€


## OMC App Stack

This section covers some of the general technologies used for the OMC application.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the open-source, object-relational database management system used in the OMC app. 

Below is a video tutorial covering everything there is to know about PostgreSQL. Because the video is 4 hours long, the tutorial was included as a recommendation for students interested in databases and how the current database that the OMC application runs on is structured. However, it is not required to know all there is to PostgreSQL to contribute to the app. ðŸ™‚

### Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript server runtime environment designed to build fast and scalable network applications.

### ExpressJS

ExpressJS is a Node.js web application framework that provides convenient features to make web development quicker and easier.

### Vue.js

Vue.js is the frontend JavaScript framework used to build SPAs (single-page applications) and UIs (user interfaces). As Vue uses a HTML-based template syntax and inline CSS to style components, familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript makes learning Vue much simpler.

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZXt1Aom3Cs' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

> [Vue's docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) provide elaborate information about the framework
