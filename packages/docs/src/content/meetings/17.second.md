The format of the meeting consisted of clarifications on event registration, payments, and the beginnings of the UI.

## Events

- Infinitely recurring events are not going to be used.
- Events that recur on the range of years are also unnecessary.
- Other Google Calendar recurrence features are desired.
- Anyone should be able to see all events even if they're not able to register to them.
- However, events should be able to be published as a draft, allowing only admins to see them so they can plan future events before they're ready for users.
- Events should be able to be marked online only, overriding the `location` field.

## Projects

- Non-recurring events could, or could not, be part of a project.
- Recurring events **must** be part of a project.
- Projects can be paid per-event, weekly, or all-at-once as set by admins during project creation, overriding any event-level payment settings.
- Every project and event will have a link for donations that, if donated to, stores what event or project the user donated to.

## Event Registrations

- Parents can register multiple students to a single event at the same time, requiring multi-item PayPal checkout flow.

## PayPal Payments (Incomplete)

- Events that are not associated with a project may have a 1-time fee or no fee.
- Events in a project, recurring or otherwise, utilize the payment scheme described on the project:
- Late payment behavior will depend on how the project is setup:
  1.  Deny late registrations entirely.
  2.  Require the full payment anyway.
  3.  Switch to a per-event fee.
  4.  **MAJOR UNCERTAIN** Utilize a sliding-scale fee to make up the difference based on the number of remaining events. _Severe potential conflicts with current design_.

## Accounts

- Accounts will have an admin-configurable balance.
  1. If an event is cancelled, the fees are refunded as account balance.
  2. Parents can mail in checks or add to their balance through cash in person.
  3. The balance can be used to pay fees, fully or in part.

## Users

- Admins will be able to create user **tags** that act as an override on a specific permission that can be manually applied to users. For example, an outside company sponsors an event, so students that are part of that group can be given a tag not requiring them to pay the normal fee for just that sponsored event.
- Parents set grade level once. The system will store both the `grade_level` and `grade_set_date` and add a grade for however many times **August 1st** has elapsed since then as a computed property on user retrieval.
- Once a user turns 18, their grade level is some "Graduated" value, and the user is treated as an adult.
- Adult users should be able to customize an optional `occupation` field to set if they are in college, working, ...etc.
- Users will be given a random default profile picture and will be allowed to select a new one on their account management page from a list of pre-determined avatars.

## Questions

1. If events are meant to be purchased in specific windows, e.g. in a week block, or an entire class, is there an expectation that users are registered for all of these events at once. If not, they'd be expected to register for each class.

## Notes for Programmer Documentation

- The design _hydrates_ events through a GET request the first time a specific range of dates is retrieved. This means infinitely recurring events are supported by default, however, certain systems such as projects may have issues rectifying events with no end. It may be useful at some point in the future to create _something else_ that is infinitely recurring by adapting the logic, for example with quizzes, games, or assignments that reward points that continue forever but can only be done once. So the ability to make recurring events is disallowed, but is possible within the system.

## Design Ideas
