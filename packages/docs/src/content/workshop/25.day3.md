## OMC App Exercise: Page Creation

<alert type="danger">
    The following exercise can ONLY be completed if you have the application running locally on your machine. However, students are welcome to view the exercises whether or not they have a local environment running.
</alert>

The goal of this exercise is to create a new page within the app that will appear in the bottom navigation bar. After the basic template for the page is set up, students can customize the page however they would like. Completion of the exercise will resemble the GIF below.

### Navigation Bar Modification

- Navigate to `packages/client/src/layouts/default.vue`
- Scroll to where the component is defined and the items in the navigation bar are listed
- Follow the same structure as the existing items to add a new item to the list (after Account)
    - <badge style="margin: 0">icon:</badge> Head to [Pictogrammers](https://pictogrammers.github.io/@mdi/font/5.4.55/) to pick out an icon. There are over 5000 icons so if you have an idea of what icon you would like, use `CTRL + F` (`CMD + F` on Mac) to narrow down your selection. If not, feel free to scroll until you find one you'd like to use! 
        
        (`mdi-lightbulb-group` and `mdi-layers-triple` are great example icons if you do not wish to search for an icon) 
    - <badge style="margin: 0">title:</badge> Name the item 'Workshop'. This title will appear under the icon in the bottom navigation bar.
    - <badge style="margin: 0">to:</badge> Enter `'/workshop'` for this line.

    Save this file by pressing `CTRL + S` (`CMD + S` on Mac)

    <details>
    <summary>If struggling, click here to view code</summary>
    
    ```JavaScript
    {
        icon: 'mdi-lightbulb-group',
        title: 'Workshop',
        to: '/workshop',
    },
    ```
    </details>

- Next we will make the folder and file for the routing to properly work. In the VS Code file explorer, below `layouts` where you are currently located, right click `pages` and then `New Folder`. Name the folder `workshop` and press enter. Now right click on this newly created folder and create a new file named `index.vue`. This newly created file should open immediately.

### Defining Initial Component

- As our file is empty, we want to now set up our component and have it display text on the page. We need a `<template>` element to contain the HTML code that will be displayed on the screen. Within our template will be a `<div>` and `<h2>` element. Display whatever text you would like within the header element.
    <details>
    <summary>If struggling, click here to view code</summary>
    
    ```JavaScript
    <template>
        <div>
            <h2>This is a header element!</h2>
        </div>
    </template>
    ```
    </details>
- Below our template is where we will define our Vue component. We first note that our scripting language is TypeScript and then import the necessary resources to achieve our next tasks. Copy and paste the following code into the file:

    ```JavaScript
    <script lang="ts"> 
    import { computed, defineComponent } from '@nuxtjs/composition-api'
    import { useAuth } from '@/stores'

    export default defineComponent({
        setup() {

            return {

            }
        },
        head: {
            title: 'Workshop Demo'
        }
    })
    </script>
    ```

    Feel free to change the title, this title will be displayed in the browser tab when the page is opened.
- We can now compile our code and view our changes live on our local server. Ensure all files are saved! If the dev environment is running, changes will be displayed upon every file save. If your dev environment is not running, visit [initialization](/installation/development#initialization). Our output thus far should look like the image below.

    <img src="/omc-app/images/workshop/initial-page.png" />

### Adding Cards

We should now see our newly created tab in the navigation bar and our message on the screen! üéâüéâüéâ  But our page looks quite basic so it's time to add a card!

- Replace the `<h2>` element with the following block of code:

    ```JavaScript
    <v-card>
        <v-card-title>This is a card!</v-card-title>
        <v-card-subtitle></v-card-subtitle>
        <v-card-text></v-card-text>
    </v-card>
    ```

- As you can see, our "This is a card!" text is displayed on the screen in the card's title. Follow the same structure to add whatever text you would like to the card's subtitle and body text elements. The current output should resemble the following image.

    <img src="/omc-app/images/workshop/card.png" />

### Displaying User Data

We will now revisit our script below our template that defines our component. Earlier, we imported `computed` and `useAuth` which will now be used to access data for the current user.

- Modify the current file to match the following block of code:
    ```JavaScript
    <script lang="ts"> 
    import { computed, defineComponent } from '@nuxtjs/composition-api'
    import { useAuth } from '@/stores'

    export default defineComponent({
        setup() {
            const authStore = useAuth()

            return {
                user: computed(() => authStore.user!),
                isVolunteer: computed(() => authStore.isVolunteer),
            }
        },
        head: {
            title: 'Workshop Demo'
        }
    })
    </script>
    ```

- Now scroll back up to our card and replace the current title text with:

    ```JavaScript
    My name is {{ user.name }} üòÅ
    ```

    If you save the file, the current user's name should appear in the title of the card on the local server.
- Next we will replace our card subtitle to display whether or not the user is registered as a volunteer. Replace the current subtitle text with the following line of code:

    ```JavaScript
    Am I registered as a volunteer? {{ isVolunteer ? "üëç" : "üëé" }}
    ```

    <alert type="info">

    `isVolunteer ? "üëç" : "üëé"` is an example of a conditional operator whose syntax looks like `condition ? value-if-true : value-if-false`. Therefore, if the user is registered as a volunteer, a üëç  will be displayed. Otherwise, a üëé will appear.

    </alert>

    Upon file save, the card's subtitle should reflect this change.
- Lastly, we will modify the card's body to display the user's avatar. Replace the card's body text with the following code:

    ```JavaScript
    <v-card-text>
        <v-img :src="user.avatarUrl" />
        This is my avatar!
    </v-card-text>
    ```

    Yet again, upon file save all changes to our card will be live. The image will likely be very large but we will adjust that soon.

    <img src="/omc-app/images/workshop/user-data.gif" />

### Styling Elements 

Though global styles were automatically applied to our page and card element, we can create custom styling for our elements. The scripting language the app uses for styling is SCSS, a superset of CSS with more advanced features than traditional CSS.

<alert type="danger">
    Note that styling changes may not instantly be displayed upon file save. You may need to refresh the page in the browser for changes to apply.
</alert>

- Copy the following code to the `index.vue` file:

    ```JavaScript
    <style lang="scss" scoped>

    </style>
    ```

    (Adding `scoped` means the styles will only be applied to elements within the file rather than making universal styling changes)

- Scroll back up to our card and add `class="title"` to the title tag. We can now reference this class in our scoped style sheet at the bottom of the file.

    <details>
    <summary>If struggling, click here to view code</summary>
    
    ```JavaScript
    <v-card-title class="title">My name is {{ user.name }} üòÅ</v-card-title>
    ```
    &
    ```JavaScript
    <style lang="scss" scoped>
    
    .title {

    }

    </style>
    ```
    </details>

- Let's change the font's size and color. Within our reference, set `font-weight: 700` and `color: rgb(140, 60, 105)`. This will increase the font's weight and change the font color to a purple/maroon rgb value.
    - Now head to [Color Picker](https://g.co/kgs/S7BpKD) to replace the current RGB value with whichever you would like.
- Next we will add `class="subtitle"` to the card's subtitle tag, return to the styles, add the selector, and change the font's alignment with `text-align: center` and overline it with `text-decoration: overline`.
- Lastly, we will adjust the size and shape of the displayed image. Add `class="pic"` to the `v-img` element, add the selector in the styles, and copy the following code:

    ```CSS
    .pic {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        border-radius: 50%;
    }
    ```

The final output should look similar to the image below.

<img src="/omc-app/images/workshop/final-card.png" />

<alert type="info">
    The exercise is now complete! üéâ Students are free to mess around with the code to add additional cards or styling properties.
</alert>
