Admins create a recurring event that lasts 2 months and they want to split the events into weekly tutoring sessions.\n2. All events are tagged with a `project` named **Tutoring**, or whatever, during the creation of the recurring event.\n3.

Admins create a recurring event that lasts 2 months and they want to split the events into weekly tutoring sessions.\n2. The admin creates a course and within it picks a project or creates a new one, then associates it with the event.\n3. During a recurring event creation, all courses are added automatically if they want the entire range to be a single course, otherwise the courses are added to events manually.\n\nThis pattern provides more relational integrity, however without thorough UI design, utilizing these could be tedious and annoying.\n\n- _Pros_: Highly explicit admin actions with no room for ambiguity on their part. Less data usage as courses are connected to events using a single event `id` and not a `start` and `end` for a date range.\n- _Cons_: The concept of a range of events is _mostly_ unused, however some payment logic may still need to consider the total number of events, for instance, if sliding-scale payments were ever implemented. If the admins don't utilize recurring events, or use recurring events but need multiple courses within the range of the generated recurring events, most likely manual assignment is required. In theory, this is a UI problem that can be solved at a later point in time.\n\n## UI Components\n\nVuetify comes with a versatile date picker that can be used for creating a course.

The OMC application will be running in a Linux production environment meaning some procedures may need to be different for Windows machines. The guides will attempt to be thorough, but some Windows-only workarounds may be overlooked. It can be said with complete confidence that Windows will support all of the features discussed, but some occasional weirdness may need to be rectified using a quick Google search.\n\nIf you are not familiar with Linux, WSL is also a great way of learning this essential skill.\n\nThe Windows Subsystem for Linux comes in two flavors, WSL v1 or WSL v2. Unless some installation issue is encountered, it's recommended to install WSL v2 as it simplifies the Docker installation.\n\n<alert type=\"warning\">\n\nManipulating files that reside within WSL from Windows, or vice versa, have significant performance drawbacks. Similarly, some of the development tools are setup to detect changes in code and automatically re-compile. If you run code that is in Windows, e.g. on your desktop, from a WSL 2 Linux terminal, it will be unable to detect file changes and lead to confusing issues. It's recommended if you use WSL you also use Git for WSL, the VSCode WSL extension, and keep your files in the WSL home directory.\n\n</alert>\n\n## Installation\n\nRefer to the [Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for the installation. The link also refers to tutorials, FAQs, and some basic troubleshooting tips. Most issues encountered are likely due to Virtualization needing to be enabled (or in some cases, disabled) on your machine.\n\nWhen you reach the [Install your Linux distribution of choice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice) part of the above guide, it's recommended to install the latest version of Ubuntu. You can install either `Ubuntu 20.04`, which is the latest as of writing this guide, or the generic `Ubuntu` item from the store. The latter will always update to the latest LTS release of Ubuntu for you.\n\n## Basic Usability\n\nThis guide is not going to cover Linux, as we'd have no time to actually work on the project. I recommend the [Basic Linux Commands for Beginners](https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners) article by Alok Naushad for a succinct introduction to Linux. However, there are some commands that are unique to WSL.\n\nFrom a PowerShell or Command Prompt terminal in Windows you can manipulate and list your Linux distros with the `wsl --help` command, if you type only `wsl` it will open your default distro.\n\n### Viewing Linux files in Explorer\n\nIt's possible to view the Linux directories from within Explorer. Within your Linux terminal, you can run the following command. The `.` being the current directory; the command works similarly to the `cd` command, only that it opens Explorer.\n\n```\nexplorer.exe .\n```\n\nYou can also double click on the address bar of explorer and type in `\\\\wsl$` and your active distros will be shown as network folders you can interact with. Keep in mind, as was warned above, manipulating files in this manner is not ideal and should only be done occasionally.\n\n## Visual Studio Code\n\n<alert type=\"danger\">\n\nIf you wish to keep your code within WSL, this extension is required! As mentioned above, application will not start correctly if you keep the code in one operating system and run it from another.\n\n</alert>\n\nVSCode has an extension called [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) that allows you to run VSCode from within WSL itself. This has benefits of using your Linux terminal, commands, and Git installation. Once you have the extension installed you can use a command similar to the `explorer.exe` command to open up code.\n\n```\ncode .\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-remote-release/images/remote-wsl-open-code.gif\" />\n\n## Other Terminals\n\nWhen you aren't in your IDE you may want to use a different terminal than the one provided by your Distro.

Heroku allows you to spin up _dynos_ that load on demand for free, so long as you don't go over your monthly limit. It's a great way to show off projects and deploy them without any headache.\n","dir":"/en/meetings","path":"/en/meetings/non-profit","extension":".md","slug":"non-profit","createdAt":"2020-09-25T21:29:34.921Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-25T21:29:34.921Z","to":"/meetings/non-profit","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601069422957},"$loki":7},{"title":"Second

This documentation is written to be opinionated to maintain a consistent experience. Experienced users may find it more comfortable to utilize tools they are more comfortable or familiar with.\n\nThis guide will go over the following tools:\n\n<list :items=\"items\"></list>\n\nIf you are on Windows, take a look at the [Linux on Windows](/development/wsl) section if you are interested in an alternative installation method using Linux.\n\n<alert>\n\nIt's recommended to tell your computer to show `File name extensions`. Windows does not show them by default, and can be toggled by clicking on the `View` menu in Explorer and look for the checkboxes near the right.\n\n</alert>\n\n## Node.js\n\nThe frontend and backend both utilize Node.js version `14` at the time of writing this. If you are reading this guide in the future, the website may have transitioned to a higher major version of Node, so check with the current developers. A different first number in the version of Node means breaking changes, so be sure not to use an incompatible version.\n\n### Windows\n\nFor Windows users, simply visit the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and download the latest `14.X` version of node and click through the installer.\n\n### Linux, Mac, or WSL\n\nIf you are not using a Windows machine, or are using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](/development/wsl) there is a highly recommended tool for managing your Node version called the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).\n\nVisit the [Install & Update Script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) section of the NVM documentation and run either of the commands in your terminal. If you don't know if you have `curl` or `wget` you can test either in your terminal, though you likely have both. Once the installation is complete, restart your terminal and you should then be able to run `nvm --help` to view all of the commands.\n\nTo install Node you can use the following command.\n\n```sh\nnvm install 14\n```\n\nOnce it finishes you should be able to see your default Node version set to 14 with the `list` command.\n\n```\nnvm list\n```\n\nYou can use `nvm install 14` again to update the minor versions of Node, as well as view the other commands in the help menu for changing your default and removing old versions.\n\n### Testing Node\n\nTo test that the installation was successful you should be able to open a terminal and receive a version for **both** of the following commands. If these commands don't work, restarting your computer will likely fix it.\n\n```sh\nnode -v\n```\n\nThe version of NPM displayed is unimportant.\n\n```sh\nnpm -v\n```\n\nIn order to test out Node, you can create any file with a `.js` extension, for example `index.js` and type some code like the example below into it. Once the file is saved, open a terminal and navigate to the same folder containing the `.js` file and run `node <file-name>.js`, e.g. `node index.js`. You should see your output.\n\n```js[index.js]\nconst name = \"John\";\nconsole.log(`My name is ${name}`);\n```\n\n## Git\n\nThis application is stored on GitHub in the spirit of open, extensible software. GitHub can be operated using GUIs, or graphical clients that allow you to manage project changes, however it's recommended to learn some basic git commands. Git is not as intuitive as other pieces of software, but Visual Studio Code provides some GUI-based functionality making pulling and pushing changes easy.\n\n### Windows\n\nVisit the [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) website and download the appropriate version of Git for your system. They don't make 32bit processors anymore, but if you're running on exceptionally old hardware you may need to double check.\n\nThe installation will ask you a lot of questions, however you can hit next to accept all of the defaults. If you don't know what an option means, it's better to reinstall git knowing why you need to change the option than to be confused why something isn't working in the first place.\n\nOpening PowerShell or a Command Prompt window and typing the following should show a version.\n\n```ps\ngit --version\n```\n\nIf an error appears saying the command is not found, you likely need to restart your computer.\n\n### Linux, Mac, or WSL\n\nThe Unix family of operating systems often come with Git installed. To test this, use the following command.\n\n```sh\ngit --version\n```\n\nIf git is not found, the installation may differ slightly based on your operating system. It's recommended to research the most appropriate installation guide for your OS version. Once you have it installed, ensure it is working with the above command.\n\n### Basic Git Commands\n\n#### Cloning a Repository\n\nObtaining a repository is the first major command for git. Visit a GitHub page and find the obvious green **Code** button. Then, click on the symbol to the right of the text field containing the repository url to copy it, and then run the following command.\n\n<img src=\"./images/checkout.png\" />\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/duckies/omc-app.git <folder>\n```\n\nYou can optionally specify the name of a folder after the url if you don't want the folder to be the name of the repository.\n\n#### Managing Branches\n\nOften the best way to have multiple people work on a project is to create a branch for each feature. It is named in a way that succinctly describes what it does; it allows you to branch off of the main path to make changes in an isolated environment. You can at a later point merge the changes into the main branch or rebase them.\n\n- Merging is like merging on the highway, all of the changes are put where the merge takes place all at once.\n- Rebasing is like slamming both roads together and pretending they were never apart. You lose history doing this and it's possible to muck up the main branch history if you do this improperly.\n- Squashing, compatible with both, is the idea of merging all commits (changes) of a branch into a single commit before doing a merge or rebase. This is a great feature as there may be many commits to a branch and merging or rebasing them can make the history confusing or bloated.\n\nThis allows for work to be done on that individual feature without muddying up the main branch until the feature is complete. This is especially true if the new feature requires major changes. At all times the master branch should reflect the current production system, unless you have a separate production branch or utilize some versioning scheme.\n\n- Check for the current list of branches with `git branch` (and hit q to get out of this oppressive window).\n- Switch to a branch with `git switch <branch>`.\n- Create a non-existant branch with `git switch -c <branch>`.\n- Delete a branch locally with `git branch -d <branch>` and remotely (on GitHub) with `git push origin --delete <branch>`. It will ask for your GitHub credentials whenever you try to modify a repository online.\n\n#### Making a Commit\n\nBefore talking about committing files, it's worth mentioning not all files are tracked. The most obvious exclusion being the `node_modules` folder. You can view the `.gitignore` file at the root of any repository to review any files that are not meant to be committed. Another major file is any `.env` file, as those files contain secret tokens that should never be exposed online.\n\nWhenever a change is made, git will track these changes and allow you to specify which files you want to commit with the `git add <file>` command. If you want to commit all changes you can use `git add .`, or add the `-a` argument before a commit, e.g. `git commit -a -m \"my message\"`.\n\nAs shown in the last command example a commit is done with a `git commit` command. If you use the `-m` argument it will let you enter a summary in quotes as the following argument, otherwise it will open an editor to allow you to put in a message. As a golden rule, it's not recommended to make a summary longer than 50 characters using the `-m` argument or in the first line of the commit message editor (they're both the same line). The purpose of the full-fledged editor is so you can make a space after the summary message and enter more information, with the recommended max length of that line being 72 characters. These recommendations are largely because longer messages wrap or become obscured when viewed.\n\n#### Synchronizing Changes\n\n- The `git status` command is used to check the current status of any modifications.\n- You can use `git fetch` to check if there are any remote changes. It doesn't actually modify any code, so you can do this often.\n- However, `git pull` will fetch changes and integrate it into the code, this may lead to conflicts you have to manually resolve on files with modifications.\n- Once you have made your changes and your repository is up-to-date, you can push new changes with `git push`.\n\nThere are many more aspects to git, but largely these are manged through the GitHub interface, e.g. merging, squashing, or rebasing.\n\n## Visual Studio Code\n\nFor the most part, picking an IDE is a personal experience, and there are pros and cons to some. For example, some developers prefer a more minimalistic approach to coding through the use of editors like **Vim**, **Sublime Text**, or **Notepad++**. While these editors have extensions, they largely only support code highlighting. When learning a language it may be beneficial, if not required by teachers, to use these kinds of editors since it's easier to learn when the IDE isn't making suggestions for you.\n\nThe most popular editor for Node.js development is **Visual Studio Code**. We consider it a requirement to use VSCode due to an extension that provides support for **Vue** language files that make up all of the frontend components. There are experimental tools for other editors like Atom, but we cannot affirm how well they work. Similarly, this recommendation is made for consistency: certain extensions provide support for linting, or essentially automated code checking for stylistic errors and poor coding practices, and code formatting. Both features together enforce a style that all code will adhere to regardless of who is editing it, so long as their IDE supports the proper extensions.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstalling VSCode can be done by downloading the installer from [their website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n### Extensions\n\nThe following are the required extensions you should download. If you are in WSL, ensure you are in a Linux version of VSCode before installing extensions as you will have to reinstall them if you are not.\n\nTo find the extension list, click on the tetris-esque squares on the left of the editor.\n\n#### ESLint\n\nESLint is the linter used by our project and should be installed and enabled at all times. It will ensure stylistic consistency and prevent minor programming errors.\n\n#### Prettier\n\nPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that will assist in cleaning up code. Manual formatting can be done using `Shift + Alt + F` or by right clicking an open file and finding `Format Document`.\n\nFor streamlined usage, you can also tell Prettier to format every time you save a file. You can enable this in the settings UI by opening the command prompt using `CTRL + Shift + P` and typing in _settings_ until you see `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`. Then in the search bar type in `format on save` and enable the option.\n\n#### Vetur\n\nThis extension is required for VSCode to understand Vue files. There are special requirements for getting this extension to work, so further information on it will be covered in the frontend sections.\n\n#### Optional Extensions\n\nThese are a few useful extensions but are not required.\n\n- DotENV: Env files are secret-holding files that are not normally formatted in VSCode, this extension gives them syntax highlighting.\n- Project Manager: This extension allows you to save and open different projects from within VSCode instead of having to open VSCode externally.\n- Remote - SSH: This extension is included in the Remote Development pack if you followed the WSL guide, but this extension allows you to SSH into another machine and edit code remotely.\n- npm: A simple extension that gives you some easier tools for working with NPM in the command prompt.\n- Docker: Useful if you end up utilizing the below Docker system.\n- Power Mode: Makes your coding experience a lot more sparkly.\n\n## Insomnia\n\nWhen working with an API, you need a means of testing the endpoints. If you have worked with APIs before you may have used **Postman**, a highly popular API tool. If you are comfortable with Postman, there is no need to use Insomnia, however Postman has become increasingly complex and company-driven and is a lot more bloated by default.\n\nTo install Insomnia, simply visit the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) website and download **Insomnia Core**. Insomnia Designer is... _something else_. Explanation on Insomnia is covered in another section.\n\n<img src=\"images/development/insomnia.png\" />\n\n## Docker\n\nDocker is a developmental tool that containerizes software. You may have installed some software in the past that required some dependency you had to run around to find. Then maybe the version you installed was wrong, or some other software you wanted needs a different version of the same dependency. Software has to fight with the other software on your operating system and is often a huge hassle to transport to other systems. Containers solve this problem.\n\nContainers are packages with the exact dependencies and libraries that software needs and nothing else. Since these containers are isolated from your operating system and each other, they will never cause conflicts. You may also be familiar with virtual machines and wondering if they're similarly slow. As shown in the below image from the [What is a container?](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) part of Docker's website, VMs have to simulate all of the hardware whereas a container only needs to simulate operating system functions. In terms of overall performance, since they share the OS kernel the performance cost of using Docker is negligable outside of services which require bleeding-edge performance.\n\n<img src=\"images/development/docker.png\" />\n\nDocker allows us to deploy Postgres, NGINX, and Redis in seconds. It is not a requirement to use docker to work on smaller sections of the website, but the website will not start unless it has access to Postgres and Redis.

You can find out how to determine this [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running).\n\n</alert>\n\nDocker has a few different installation methods on Windows. Docker utilizes the same low-level virtualization that WSL does, with the newest versions of Docker exclusively relying on the technology.\n\n1. If you are using WSL, install [Docker Desktop with the WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/).\n2. If you are on Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, or Education you can install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).\n3. If you are on Windows 10 Home and are _not_ using WSL, you will need to install the [Legacy Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/). Some high schools and most colleges give students a free educational Windows 10 license if you are interested in upgrading your Windows version.\n\n### Linux, Mac, or WSL\n\nMac users can install [Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).\n\nLinux users can find their version of linux and install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Docker Compose notably does not come with Docker Engine, learn to [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).\n\nIt's worth noting if you are using WSL, I would recommend using Docker Desktop with the WSL interface and not utilize the engine.\n\n### Verifying Installation\n\nYou can quickly verify of Docker is installed on your computer with the following commands.\n\n```\ndocker --version\n```\n\nDocker compose is not necessary but is useful. If it was not found you may need to install it separately.\n\n```\ndocker-compose --version\n```\n\nWindows, WSL, and Mac users should be aware that Docker is an application that runs in the taskbar. It will need to be running for Docker to function properly. It's also recommended to disable the feature that has it start with Windows, as that is a bit annoying!\n\n## Datagrip\n\nOne issue with understanding databases is that the way they work can often be obscured by other things like ORMs (Object Relational Mapping) which converts the table structures of databases into the native structures of the language you're using. For example, this website will be using [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/). It lets you query the database and you get back JavaScript objects instead of tables making them easier to work with.\n\nIf you want to view the database, manually input data, tweak things, or learn SQL, it's recommended to install [JetBrains DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/). This is not normally free software, howwever students can apply to use it for free at the [JetBrains Products for Learning](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students). As a sidenote, if you do not already have the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), it's highly recommended! Probably thousands of dollars in free services, discounts, software, tutorials, and more. If you wish to learn how to store data in applications without having to learn the boring complexities of SQL, I recommend looking into a NoSQL database such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for your projects.\n\n<alert type=\"warning\">\n\nIf you are under the age of 18 please have a parent or guardian assist you in applying for a student license. You should not upload school documents containing your personal information without parental approval.\n\n</alert>\n\n<img
