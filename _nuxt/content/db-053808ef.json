All events are tagged with a `project` named **Tutoring**, or whatever, during the creation of the recurring event.\n3.

Admins create a recurring event that lasts 2 months and they want to split the events into weekly tutoring sessions.\n2. The admin creates a course and within it picks a project or creates a new one, then associates it with the event.\n3. During a recurring event creation, all courses are added automatically if they want the entire range to be a single course, otherwise the courses are added to events manually.\n\nThis pattern provides more relational integrity, however without thorough UI design, utilizing these could be tedious and annoying.\n\n- _Pros_: Highly explicit admin actions with no room for ambiguity on their part. Less data usage as courses are connected to events using a single event `id` and not a `start` and `end` for a date range.\n- _Cons_: The concept of a range of events is _mostly_ unused, however some payment logic may still need to consider the total number of events, for instance, if sliding-scale payments were ever implemented. If the admins don't utilize recurring events, or use recurring events but need multiple courses within the range of the generated recurring events, most likely manual assignment is required. In theory, this is a UI problem that can be solved at a later point in time.\n\n## UI Components\n\nVuetify comes with a versatile date picker that can be used for creating a course.

The OMC application will be running in a Linux production environment meaning some procedures may need to be different for Windows machines. The guides will attempt to be thorough, but some Windows-only workarounds may be overlooked. It can be said with complete confidence that Windows will support all of the features discussed, but some occasional weirdness may need to be rectified using a quick Google search.\n\nIf you are not familiar with Linux, WSL is also a great way of learning this essential skill.\n\nThe Windows Subsystem for Linux comes in two flavors, WSL v1 or WSL v2. Unless some installation issue is encountered, it's recommended to install WSL v2 as it simplifies the Docker installation.\n\n<alert type=\"warning\">\n\nManipulating files that reside within WSL from Windows, or vice versa, have significant performance drawbacks. Similarly, some of the development tools are setup to detect changes in code and automatically re-compile.

The link also refers to tutorials, FAQs, and some basic troubleshooting tips. Most issues encountered are likely due to Virtualization needing to be enabled (or in some cases, disabled) on your machine.\n\nWhen you reach the [Install your Linux distribution of choice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice) part of the above guide, it's recommended to install the latest version of Ubuntu. You can install either `Ubuntu 20.04`, which is the latest as of writing this guide, or the generic `Ubuntu` item from the store. The latter will always update to the latest LTS release of Ubuntu for you.\n\n## Basic Usability\n\nThis guide is not going to cover Linux, as we'd have no time to actually work on the project. I recommend the [Basic Linux Commands for Beginners](https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners) article by Alok Naushad for a succinct introduction to Linux. However, there are some commands that are unique to WSL.\n\nFrom a PowerShell or Command Prompt terminal in Windows you can manipulate and list your Linux distros with the `wsl --help` command, if you type only `wsl` it will open your default distro.\n\n### Viewing Linux files in Explorer\n\nIt's possible to view the Linux directories from within Explorer. Within your Linux terminal, you can run the following command. The `.` being the current directory; the command works similarly to the `cd` command, only that it opens Explorer.\n\n```\nexplorer.exe .\n```\n\nYou can also double click on the address bar of explorer and type in `\\\\wsl$` and your active distros will be shown as network folders you can interact with.

Within seconds the key was found and a ton of servers were spawned in my name, and a stern and scary lady had to launch this month-long inquest into reversing all of the damage and being generous enough to refund the costs of the incredibly expensive servers that were spawned; likely for crypto mining or some techy version of a demonic summoning circle to use processing power to summon long-forgotten Myspace account credentials, or something. Long story short, be careful and when in doubt reach out.\n\nI also recommend looking into less confusing services aimed towards hobbyists, for example, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home). Heroku allows you to spin up _dynos_ that load on demand for free, so long as you don't go over your monthly limit. It's a great way to show off projects and deploy them without any headache.\n","dir":"/en/meetings","path":"/en/meetings/non-profit","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-01-16T00:31:50.550Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-16T00:31:50.550Z","to":"/meetings/non-profit","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1610757152525},"$loki":7},{"slug":"second","description":"Second

If the user is younger than 13 years old they will be prompted to have a parent or guardian register in their stead. The parent or guardian can then add a sub-user to the account.\n\n- A checkbox will ask, \"Are you a currently a middle school, high school, or college student?\". Checking this box will prompt for the following fields to appear:\n\n  - A dropdown will ask if the user is in elementary school, middle school, high school, or college.\n  - Depending on the previous answer, this dropdown will populate with the grade levels for each school level. For example, high school will have 9th through 12th grade options, whereas college will have \"Undergraduate\", \"Graduate\", and \"Postgraduate\" options.\n  - A textfield will ask the user to type out the name of the school they are attending.\n  - If the user selected college, a third field will appear to ask the user their graduating year.\n\n- If the previous checkbox is not checked, another checkbox will ask the user, \"Are you an industry professional?\". Selecting this option will prompt for the following **optional** fields to appear:\n\n  - A textbox will ask the user what their job title and profession is.\n  - A secondary text box will ask for their workplace.\n\n- Users who are registered but lack a confirmed email address will be able to add other users to the account and view events but not register to them. OMC personnel can register unverified users manually, e.g. if a user is quickly filling out registration on their phone while at the event.\n\n- Secondary account users can add their own emails, though not required.\n\n- Volunteering will be enabled through the volunteer agreement on a user's account page.\n\n- Margarita is investigating the need for a Terms of Service and/or Privacy Policy and the appropriateness of the registration scheme from a legal point of view.\n\n## Permissions\n\n- Event registration can be done only by users who are at least 13 years old on the account.\n\n- Each kind of event will have different permissions.\n  - Minimum and maximum student ages.\n  - Minimum and maximum stugent grade levels.\n  - Student gender.\n\n## Questions & Concerns\n\n## Student Tutorial Sequence\n\n- The students will learn to create a competition tracker timeline. They will learn to use JavaScript and the app technology to create, find, and store competition data and sort the different competitions by date and filter by the student's grade level.\n\n- The projects page will link to the competitions page and will also be available in the hamburger menu.\n\n- The instruction medium will be follow-along videos that teach the technology with the competition tracker being a module introduced at the end for applying the tools taught. The students will have creative freedom on how they want to go about developing the page, and could be made more advanced in the future.\n\n### Registration\n\n1. The school, college, or workplace entered for the occupation field cannot be validated. By COPPA, this information cannot be revealed to other users directly without a screening process, which would complicate things. This also means there is no enforcement of consistency, so the idea of emailing all users going to the same high school is not feasible. For security reasons the field should be given a length limit to prevent users typing paragraphs into the field.\n\n2. If a student transitions to a new occupation (e.g. high school to college) or horizontally in an occupation (e.g. primary school students from middle school to high school) it's highly unlikely that users will update this information. This does not have direct ramifications outside of misleading record keeping.\n\n3. The occupation fields may need to have age limitations. For example, an 18 year old could say they're in 6th grade. However, it's reasonable to assume the expected ages of each grade level could have a standard deviation of 2-3 years in either direction. Similarly, a 13 year old probably shouldn't be able to say they're an industry professional.\n\n4. If a 13-17 year old minor can create an account they also need to be able to register to events and create users, otherwise there is no way to securely allow a 13 year old to create an 18+ parent user that has more permissions.\n\n### Permissions\n\n1. Will events limit the total number of registrations? If so, do volunteers count towards this limit, a separate limit, or can any number of volunteers can register?\n\n2. Will volunteers override the normal event permissions? For example, if an event is for 10th grade girls, can a high schooler boy volunteer for the event?\n","dir":"/en/meetings","path":"/en/meetings/third","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-01-16T00:31:50.550Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-16T00:31:50.550Z","to":"/meetings/third","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1610757152581},"$loki":9},{"slug":"competitions","description":"Build a tool to track which competitions you can try out for at OMC.","title":"Competition Tracker","category":"Tutorials","position":5,"version":"0.0.1","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"alert","props":{"type":"info"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tutorial not yet implemented! 😵"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]}]},"text":"\n<alert type=\"info\">\n\nTutorial not yet implemented! 😵\n\n</alert>\n","dir":"/en/tutorials","path":"/en/tutorials/competitions","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-01-16T00:31:50.550Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-16T00:31:50.550Z","to":"/tutorials/competitions","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1610757152583},"$loki":10},{"slug":"setup","description":"Tools and setting them up for developing the application.","title":"Installation","category":"Development","position":2,"items":["Node.js","Git","Visual Studio Code","Insomnia","Docker","Datagrip"],"toc":[{"id":"nodejs","depth":2,"text":"Node.js"},{"id":"windows","depth":3,"text":"Windows"},{"id":"linux-mac-or-wsl","depth":3,"text":"Linux, Mac, or WSL"},{"id":"testing-node","depth":3,"text":"Testing Node"},{"id":"git","depth":2,"text":"Git"},{"id":"windows-1","depth":3,"text":"Windows"},{"id":"linux-mac-or-wsl-1","depth":3,"text":"Linux, Mac, or WSL"},{"id":"basic-git-commands","depth":3,"text":"Basic Git Commands"},{"id":"visual-studio-code","depth":2,"text":"Visual Studio Code"},{"id":"installation","depth":3,"text":"Installation"},{"id":"extensions","depth":3,"text":"Extensions"},{"id":"insomnia","depth":2,"text":"Insomnia"},{"id":"docker","depth":2,"text":"Docker"},{"id":"windows-2","depth":2,"text":"Windows"},{"id":"linux-mac-or-wsl-2","depth":3,"text":"Linux, Mac, or WSL"},{"id":"verifying-installation","depth":3,"text":"Verifying Installation"},{"id":"datagrip","depth":2,"text":"Datagrip"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"These are the recommended procedures for setting up a development environment for working on the application.

This documentation is written to be verbose and opinionated to maintain a consistent experience and for inexperienced users. Some may find it more comfortable to utilize tools they are more comfortable or familiar and still be appropriate.\n\nThis guide will go over the following tools:\n\n<list :items=\"items\"></list>\n\nIf you are on Windows, take a look at the [Linux on Windows](/development/wsl) section if you are interested in utilizing a Linux terminal within Windows.\n\n<alert>\n\nIt's recommended to tell your computer to show `File name extensions`. Windows does not show them by default, and can be toggled by clicking on the `View` menu in Explorer and look for the checkboxes near the right.\n\n</alert>\n\n## Node.js\n\nThe frontend and backend both utilize Node.js version `14` at the time of writing this. If you are reading this guide in the future, the website may have transitioned to a higher major version of Node, so check with the current developers. A different first number in the version of Node means breaking changes, so be sure not to use an incompatible version.\n\n### Windows\n\nFor Windows users, simply visit the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and download the latest `14.X` version of node and click through the installer.\n\n### Linux, Mac, or WSL\n\nIf you are not using a Windows machine, or are using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](/development/wsl) there is a highly recommended tool for managing your Node version called the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).\n\nVisit the [Install & Update Script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) section of the NVM documentation and run either of the commands in your terminal. If you don't know if you have `curl` or `wget` you can test either in your terminal, though you likely have both. Once the installation is complete, restart your terminal and you should then be able to run `nvm --help` to view all of the commands.\n\nTo install Node you can use the following command.\n\n```sh\nnvm install 14\n```\n\nOnce it finishes you should be able to see your default Node version set to 14 with the `list` command.\n\n```\nnvm list\n```\n\nYou can use `nvm install 14` again to update the minor versions of Node, as well as view the other commands in the help menu for changing your default and removing old versions.\n\n### Testing Node\n\nTo test that the installation was successful you should be able to open a terminal and receive a version for **both** of the following commands. If these commands don't work, restarting your computer will likely fix it.\n\n```sh\nnode -v\n```\n\nThe version of NPM displayed is unimportant.\n\n```sh\nnpm -v\n```\n\nIn order to test out Node, you can create any file with a `.js` extension, for example `index.js` and type some code like the example below into it. Once the file is saved, open a terminal and navigate to the same folder containing the `.js` file and run `node <file-name>.js`, e.g. `node index.js`. You should see your output.\n\n```js[index.js]\nconst name = \"John\";\nconsole.log(`My name is ${name}`);\n```\n\n## Git\n\nThis application is stored on GitHub in the spirit of open and extensible software. GitHub can be operated graphically, e.g. using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), however it's recommended to utilize a standard git installation.\n\nVisual Studio Code will read information from Git and make available to you who recently changed the code you're looking at, let you create and manage commits and branches, and easily sync changes.\n\n### Windows\n\nVisit the [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) website and download the appropriate version of Git for your system. If your hardware is old enough to be 32-bit then a lot of the software here may be incompatible or too resource intensive.\n\nThe installation will ask you a lot of questions, however you may accept the defaults. If you don't know what an option means, it's better to reinstall git knowing why you need to change the option than to be confused why something isn't working in the first place.\n\nOpening PowerShell or a Command Prompt window and typing the following should show a version.\n\n```ps\ngit --version\n```\n\nIf an error appears saying the command is not found, you likely need to restart your computer.\n\n### Linux, Mac, or WSL\n\nThe Unix family of operating systems often come with Git installed. To test this, use the following command.\n\n```sh\ngit --version\n```\n\nIf git is not found, the installation may differ slightly based on your operating system. It's recommended to research the most appropriate installation guide for your OS version. Once you have it installed, ensure it is working with the above command.\n\n### Basic Git Commands\n\nThis section goes over basic Git commands and are not specific to the project. A better guide may be [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) by Roger Dudler. It's also not required by any means, but I recommend the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention for writing commit messages. Our team did not follow it all that well, but it is simple to follow if you are unsure what to write and is a popular standard.\n\n#### Cloning a Repository\n\nObtaining a repository is the first major command for git. Visit a GitHub page and find the obvious green **Code** button. Then, click on the symbol to the right of the text field containing the repository url to copy it, and then run the following command.\n\n<img src=\"./images/checkout.png\" />\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/duckies/omc-app.git <folder>\n```\n\nYou can optionally specify the name of a folder after the url if you don't want the folder to be the name of the repository.\n\nNote that Git will ask you for your password every time you commit changes using the `HTTPS` method. At the time of writing this, entering your GitHub password is considered deprecated. It is recommended to use the `SSH` method and [adding an SSH key to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases) which has the benefit of never asking you for a password. Also see [Which remote URL should I use?](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use#cloning-with-ssh-urls) that describes these methods and more.\n\n#### Managing Branches\n\nOften the best way to have multiple people work on a project is to create a branch for each feature. It is named in a way that succinctly describes what it does; it allows you to branch off of the main path to make changes in an isolated environment. You can at a later point merge the changes into the main branch or rebase them.\n\n- Merging is like merging on the highway, all of the changes are put where the merge takes place all at once.\n- Rebasing is like slamming both roads together and pretending they were never apart. You lose history doing this and it's possible to muck up the main branch history if you do this improperly.\n- Squashing, compatible with both, is the idea of merging all commits (changes) of a branch into a single commit before doing a merge or rebase. This is a great feature as there may be many commits to a branch and merging or rebasing them can make the history confusing or bloated.\n\nThis allows for work to be done on that individual feature without muddying up the main branch until the feature is complete. This is especially true if the new feature requires major changes. At all times the master branch should reflect the current production system, unless you have a separate production branch or utilize some versioning scheme.\n\n- Check for the current list of branches with `git branch` (and hit q to get out of this oppressive window).\n- Switch to a branch with `git switch <branch>`.\n- Create a non-existant branch with `git switch -c <branch>`.\n- Delete a branch locally with `git branch -d <branch>` and remotely (on GitHub) with `git push origin --delete <branch>`. It will ask for your GitHub credentials whenever you try to modify a repository online.\n\n#### Making a Commit\n\nBefore talking about committing files, it's worth mentioning not all files are tracked. The most obvious exclusion being the `node_modules` folder. You can view the `.gitignore` file at the root of any repository to review any files that are not meant to be committed. Another major file is any `.env` file, as those files contain secret tokens that should never be exposed online.\n\nWhenever a change is made, git will track these changes and allow you to specify which files you want to commit with the `git add <file>` command. If you want to commit all changes you can use `git add .`, or add the `-a` argument before a commit, e.g. `git commit -a -m \"my message\"`.\n\nAs shown in the last command example a commit is done with a `git commit` command. If you use the `-m` argument it will let you enter a summary in quotes as the following argument, otherwise it will open an editor to allow you to put in a message. As a golden rule, it's not recommended to make a summary longer than 50 characters using the `-m` argument or in the first line of the commit message editor (they're both the same line). The purpose of the full-fledged editor is so you can make a space after the summary message and enter more information, with the recommended max length of that line being 72 characters. These recommendations are largely because longer messages wrap or become obscured when viewed.\n\n#### Synchronizing Changes\n\n- The `git status` command is used to check the current status of any modifications.\n- You can use `git fetch` to check if there are any remote changes. It doesn't actually modify any code, so you can do this often.\n- However, `git pull` will fetch changes and integrate it into the code, this may lead to conflicts you have to manually resolve on files with modifications.\n- Once you have made your changes and your repository is up-to-date, you can push new changes with `git push`.\n\nThere are many more aspects to git, but largely these are manged through the GitHub interface, e.g. merging, squashing, or rebasing.\n\n## Visual Studio Code\n\nFor the most part, picking an IDE is a personal experience, and there are pros and cons to some. For example, some developers prefer a more minimalistic approach to coding through the use of editors like **Vim**, **Sublime Text**, or **Notepad++**. While these editors have extensions, they largely only support code highlighting. When learning a language it may be beneficial, if not required by teachers, to use these kinds of editors since it's easier to learn when the IDE isn't making suggestions for you.\n\nThe most popular editor for Node.js development is **Visual Studio Code**. We consider it a requirement to use VSCode due to an extension that provides support for **Vue** language files that make up all of the frontend components. There are experimental tools for other editors like Atom, but we cannot affirm how well they work. Similarly, this recommendation is made for consistency: certain extensions provide support for linting, or essentially automated code checking for stylistic errors and poor coding practices, and code formatting. Both features together enforce a style that all code will adhere to regardless of who is editing it, so long as their IDE supports the proper extensions.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstalling VSCode can be done by downloading the installer from [their website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n### Extensions\n\nThe following are the required extensions you should download. If you are in WSL, ensure you are in a Linux version of VSCode before installing extensions as you will have to reinstall them if you are not.\n\nTo find the extension list, click on the tetris-esque squares on the left of the editor.\n\n#### ESLint\n\nESLint is the linter used by our project and should be installed and enabled at all times. It will ensure stylistic consistency and prevent minor programming errors.\n\n#### Prettier\n\nPrettier is an opinionated code formatter that will assist in cleaning up code. Manual formatting can be done using `Shift + Alt + F` or by right clicking an open file and finding `Format Document`.\n\nFor streamlined usage, you can also tell Prettier to format every time you save a file. You can enable this in the settings UI by opening the command prompt using `CTRL + Shift + P` and typing in _settings_ until you see `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`. Then in the search bar type in `format on save` and enable the option.\n\n#### Vetur\n\nThis extension is required for VSCode to understand Vue files. There are special requirements for getting this extension to work, so further information on it will be covered in the frontend sections.\n\n#### Optional Extensions\n\nThese are a few useful extensions but are not required.\n\n- DotENV: Env files are secret-holding files that are not normally formatted in VSCode, this extension gives them syntax highlighting.\n- Project Manager: This extension allows you to save and open different projects from within VSCode instead of having to open VSCode externally.\n- Remote - SSH: This extension is included in the Remote Development pack if you followed the WSL guide, but this extension allows you to SSH into another machine and edit code remotely.\n- npm: A simple extension that gives you some easier tools for working with NPM in the command prompt.\n- Docker: Useful if you end up utilizing the below Docker system.\n- Power Mode: Makes your coding experience a lot more sparkly.\n\n## Insomnia\n\nWhen working with an API, you need a means of testing the endpoints. If you have worked with APIs before you may have used **Postman**, a highly popular API tool. If you are comfortable with Postman, there is no need to use Insomnia, however Postman has become increasingly complex and company-driven and is a lot more bloated by default.\n\nTo install Insomnia, simply visit the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) website and download **Insomnia Core**. Insomnia Designer is... _something else_. Explanation on Insomnia is covered in another section.\n\n<img src=\"images/development/insomnia.png\" />\n\n## Docker\n\nDocker is a developmental tool that containerizes software. You may have installed some software in the past that required some dependency you had to run around to find. Then maybe the version you installed was wrong, or some other software you wanted needs a different version of the same dependency. Software has to fight with the other software on your operating system and is often a huge hassle to transport to other systems. Containers solve this problem.\n\nContainers are packages with the exact dependencies and libraries that software needs and nothing else. Since these containers are isolated from your operating system and each other, they will never cause conflicts. You may also be familiar with virtual machines and wondering if they're similarly slow. As shown in the below image from the [What is a container?](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) part of Docker's website, VMs have to simulate all of the hardware whereas a container only needs to simulate operating system functions. In terms of overall performance, since they share the OS kernel the performance cost of using Docker is negligable outside of services which require bleeding-edge performance.\n\n<img src=\"images/development/docker.png\" />\n\nDocker allows us to deploy Postgres, NGINX, and Redis in seconds. It is not a requirement to use docker to work on smaller sections of the website, but the website will not start unless it has access to Postgres and Redis. You are welcome to source these elsewhere and manually configure the website locally to use these connections.\n\n## Windows\n\n<alert>\n\nYou will need to know what edition of Windows you have: Home, Pro, Enterprise, or Education. You can find out how to determine this [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running).\n\n</alert>\n\nDocker has a few different installation methods on Windows. Docker utilizes the same low-level virtualization that WSL does, with the newest versions of Docker exclusively relying on the technology.\n\n1. If you are using WSL, install [Docker Desktop with the WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/).\n2. If you are on Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, or Education you can install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).\n3. If you are on Windows 10 Home and are _not_ using WSL, you will need to install the [Legacy Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/). Some high schools and most colleges give students a free educational Windows 10 license if you are interested in upgrading your Windows version.\n\n### Linux, Mac, or WSL\n\nMac users can install [Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).\n\nLinux users can find their version of linux and install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Docker Compose notably does not come with Docker Engine, learn to [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).\n\nIt's worth noting if you are using WSL, I would recommend using Docker Desktop with the WSL interface and not utilize the engine.\n\n### Verifying Installation\n\nYou can quickly verify of Docker is installed on your computer with the following commands.\n\n```\ndocker --version\n```\n\nDocker compose is not necessary but is useful. If it was not found you may need to install it separately.\n\n```\ndocker-compose --version\n```\n\nWindows, WSL, and Mac users should be aware that Docker is an application that runs in the taskbar. It will need to be running for Docker to function properly. It's also recommended to disable the feature that has it start with Windows, as that is a bit annoying!\n\n## Datagrip\n\nOne issue with understanding databases is that the way they work can often be obscured by other things like ORMs (Object Relational Mapping) which converts the table structures of databases into the native structures of the language you're using. For example, this website will be using [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/). It lets you query the database and you get back JavaScript objects instead of tables making them easier to work with.\n\nIf you want to view the database, manually input data, tweak things, or learn SQL, it's recommended to install [JetBrains DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/). This is not normally free software, howwever students can apply to use it for free at the [JetBrains Products for Learning](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students). As a sidenote, if you do not already have the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), it's highly recommended! Probably thousands of dollars in free services, discounts, software, tutorials, and more. If you wish to learn how to store data in applications without having to learn the boring complexities of SQL, I recommend looking into a NoSQL database such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for your projects.\n\n<alert type=\"warning\">\n\nIf you are under the age of 18 please have a parent or guardian assist you in applying for a student license.

The technologies used require paid Azure resources.\n\n</alert>\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following items will be required before setting up the application.\n\n1. Azure Portal with configured subscription. The subscription is merely the payment grouping that has the credits available for use.\n2. Domain Management. The application is designed to operate with the frontend on a primary domain and the api on an entirely separate domain, e.g. `app.orlandomathcircle.org` and `api.orlandomathcircle.org`, and need to be configured using A records to the virtual machine. SendGrid emailing will use a few records to ensure email authentication.\n2. PayPal API credentials. The OMC personnel who owns the Orlando Math Circle PayPal account needs to follow the steps to [Obtain PayPal Credentials](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/overview/#get-credentials) through registering the application on the developer dashboard. This yields a `Client ID` and `Client Key`. Both identifiers are necessary to make PayPal payments. For safety during testing, developers can use their own PayPal developer credentials in a Sandbox mode to not risk accidentially using real money.\n2. Twitter API Credentials. Someone within the OMC organization needs to apply to utilize the Twitter API. They utilize an [approval process](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) and provide a `Client Key` and `Client Secret` similar to PayPal.\n3. SendGrid API Credentials. This tutorial will go through setting up SendGrid as it is part of Azure.\n\n## Azure\n\n### Virtual Machine Procurement\n\nThe virtual machine that should host the application is a called a `Standard_B2s`, which consists of 2 vCPU cores and 4GB of memory. To manage virtual machines you can visit the `Virtual machines` resource in the Azure portal.\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_vms.png\" alt=\"Azure Virtual Machines Sidebar\" />\n\nFind the add button at the top of the virtual machines directory and select the first option in the dropdown.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_add.png\" alt=\"Azure Add Virtual Machine\" />\n\nThe page should show various configurations for allocating a new virtual machine. The first option of which are the subscription and resource group. Subscriptions are services that are billed together and having a singular default subscription is sufficient. The resource group is like a \"folder to organize and manage your resources\", but creating a new resource group of any name will suffice. This guide does not cover resource group permissions.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_setup_1.png\" alt=\"Azure Groups\" />\n\nThe next options are the `instance details` which consist of the desired amount of power, its location, and the operating system.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_setup_2.png\" alt=\"Azure Instance Details\" />\n\n- The virtual machine name is an identifier, I have chosen `omc-app`.\n- The `region` affects which datacenter to allocate the machine on, the closer to the users the better the latency. For Florida, `(US) East US` is ideal.\n- Ignore the `Availability options` and `Availability zone` settings.\n- For the `image` select `see all images` and search for Ubuntu to find `Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS`. If this guide is being utilized in the future, the latest **LTS** version of Ubuntu is desired.\n- Do not tick the `Azure Spot instance` setting.\n- For `Size` the option desired is `Standard_B2s - 2 vcpus, 4 GiB memory ($30.37/month)`. It can be found by selecting `See all sizes` and typing `B2s` into the search bar.\n\nNext, some sort of credentials need to be given to allow for accessing the default administrator account. As a personal preference I have used an RSA public key so the virtual machine simply recognizes my computer without having to enter a password all the time. This can be changed later and will not affect secondary users added to the VM.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_setup_3.png\" alt=\"Azure Account Details\" />\n\nThe last set of configurations on this page are the `Inbound port rules` which describes which ports are open to the internet by default. `SSH (22)` is selected by default for remote access, but be sure to also enable `HTTPS (443)` and `HTTP (80)` as those are the ports responsible for website traffic. Note that this is not exhaustive and does not include the PostgreSQL port (if remote database management is desired).\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_setup_4.png\" alt=\"Azure Port Details\" />\n\nThe rest of the pages consist of more advanced features that aren't required to be changed or can be changed at a later date when necessary. Of note, the `Standard B2s` instance comes with 8 GiB of temporary storage by default. While not an immediate concern, eventually the uploads will consume that free space and require the instance to be affixed with a managed storage drive.\n\nSo click on `Review + create` and it may ask for additional contact information such as the preferred email address and phone number for support issues. Once the information is entered, click on `Create` where the review button was at the bottom of the page and allow for the instance to be generated. It should take only a couple of minutes for deployment to complete.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_setup_5.png\" alt=\"Azure Instance Details\" />\n\nOnce the instance is deployed it can be found by visiting the \"Virtual machines\" section of the Azure portal. Copy the `Public IP address` and using the login information input in the credentials section of the instance configuration, connect to the instance using your preferred terminal.\n\n<alert type=\"info\">\n\nIdentifying information is not hidden from the following screenshots, though this virtual machine instance was destroyed before this tutorial went live, do not share screenshots showing connection information.\n\n</alert>\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_terminal_1.png\" alt=\"Azure Instance Details\" />\n\n### PostgreSQL Procurement\n\nPostgreSQL can be obtained in a number of different ways. The virtual machine is more than strong enough to host PostgreSQL alongside the server, within Docker, or connect through a managed instance. The database is what contains the most sensitive information and to ensure it isn't lost due to the volatility of the temporary virtual machine instance storage, using a managed PostgreSQL instance from Azure is preferred. This incurs a similar cost to the virtual machine itself but works best given the amount of credits OMC can utilize.\n\n- To get sarted, in the search box of the Azure portal type in `Postgres` and select the option `Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers`.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_pg_1.png\" />\n\nOnce at the directory listing, click on `Add` at the top and click create underneath `Single Server`.\n\nFor the `Project details` section, fill it out similarly to the virtual machine.\n\nUnder `Server details` start fill out the sections as appropriate:\n- Give the server a name, though it does not matter. I chose `omc-db`.\n- Do not change `Data source`.\n- Ensure the `Location` is set to `(US) East US`.\n- Under `Version` change it to `11`. This changes the PostgreSQL version to 11.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_pg_2.png\" />\n\nClick on `Configure server` under `Compute + storage` and the end of the `Server details` section. Here, click on the tab at the top to change the server type to `Basic`. Modify the settings to match, with a picture as a reference.\n\n<alert type=\"info\">\n\nIf the image is too small to see, open it in a new tab to view it in full size.\n\n</alert>\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_pg_3.png\" />\n\n1. Slide the `vCore` setting until it says `1 vCore`. This is the number of CPU cores the database server will utilize. One is sufficient for a small application.\n2. Slide the `Storage` setting to the far left until it says `5 GB`. 5 Gigabytes of database storage is a lot for the app and will likely not be reached. This will scale if necessary due to the following setting, but setting this as low as possible cuts back on unnecessary costs.\n3. Ensure the `Storage Auto-growth` setting remains on **Yes**. In the event the database is nearly reaching the 5 GB size limit, it will grow automatically. \n4. Leave the `Backup Retention Period` set to **7 Days**. Backups and retention policies can be modified by OMC if it is determined necessary.\n\nClick on `OK` at the bottom to return to the PostgreSQL creation page. Fill out the `Administrator account` section as desired with the desired login credentials for the web administrator.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_pg_4.png\" />\n\nClick on `Review + create` at the bottom and wait for provisioning.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_pg_5.png\" />\n\nOnce provisioning is finished, return to the PostgreSQL directory listing and find the server instance. The database needs to be configured to accept certain authorized incoming connections.\n\nWhile still on the management page for the database, on the left hand side under `Settings`, click on `Connection security`. From there, click on `Add current client IP address ( <your ip> )`. This will need to be done to each computer that wants remote access, or for testing purposes you can click on the `+ Add 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255` to allow all IP addresses to connect. Go ahead and also add the IP address of the virtual machine. Once done, click on `Save` in the above toolbar.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_pg_6.png\" />\n\nUsing the `Admin username`, the `Server name` and the password I set during the setup procedure, I am able to connect to the database using my preferred client, DataGrip. By default, PostgreSQL uses a port of 5432. Azure provides a guuide on [configuring a firewall rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/quickstart-create-server-database-portal#configure-a-firewall-rule) and [connecting to the server with psql](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/quickstart-create-server-database-portal#connect-to-the-server-with-psql) CLI and making a new database manually if you do not have a database management tool.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_pg_7.png\" />\n\nWhile connected, create a new database for the application to use. I created one named `omc`, though the application can be configured for any database name.\n\n### SendGrid Account Creation\n\nThe SendGrid service provided by Azure will handle emailing. In the Azure portal search box type in SendGrid and click on `SendGrid Accounts`. In the directory, click on `New`.\n\nSetting up a new SendGrid account is largely administrative. The only configurable setting is the pricing tier which can be left on the lowest pricing tier. The contact information should be for the webmaster. Click on `Review + create` and await the deployment provisioning.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/sendgrid_1.png\" />\n\nOnce completed, visit the SendGrid account resource that was just created and click on the blue `Manage` button. A welcome page will greet you, but do not click on the blue button, instead click on `Authenticate a domain instead`.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/sendgrid_2.png\" />\n\nThe next page will ask you where the DNS servers for the website are. Unless you have knowingly changed them they default to the provider in which the domain was purchased from. In my case that would be Google, so I selected `Google Cloud` from the dropdown. For Bluehost, the domain provider of OMC, it will need to be input manually in the \"Other\" option at the bottom. Also select `Yes` for the second option.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/sendgrid_3.png\" />\n\nOn the next page it will simply ask for the domain you are sending from. This is the root domain of the website, e.g. `orlandomathcircle.org` or `johng.dev` in my case. On the following page it will provide a list of `CNAME` records to add to the domain in order to verify ownership and provide other security features. I will be doing this on Google Domains, though the process is usually ubiquitous.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/sendgrid_4.png\" />\n<img src=\"images/production/sendgrid_5.png\" />\n\nOnce they are added you can click on the checkbox at the bottom verifying that they were added and click on `Verify` to check. If any are not working it will let you know which records are not found. It rarely takes more than a minute for DNS changes to propagate, though it rarely can take much longer. Once this is complete and SendGrid gives you a success message, click on `Settings` on the left toolbar and then `API Keys` beneath it.\n\nCreate a new API Key, name it `App Credentials` or similar, and make sure it has full access.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/sendgrid_6.png\" />\n\nOnce created it will show you a key. Click to copy it and paste it into a file to save it temporarily until it's used later. The key will not be shown again, though it can be regenerated.\n\n<alert type=\"info\">\n\nThe application uses emailing templates to send emails in a structured way, however they were not completed by the first team. The second team will either need to create emailing templates or the app can send text-based emails as a fallback.\n\n</alert>\n\n## Virtual Machine Setup\nOnce the virtual machine is operational, some software needs to be installed in order to run the application.\n\n### Installing Node.js\n\nNode.js, the JavaScript server runtime, is installed using a small tool and a couple of commands.\n\n- Visit the [NVM Installation Script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) page and copy the first link and run it in the terminal on the virtual machine. This installs the `Node Version Manager`, making it easy to install Node.js.\n- Once that is finished, reopen the terminal and connect to the virtual machine once again.\n- Run the following command.\n  ```\n  nvm install 14\n  ```\n\n- Double check that Node.js is now installed and set to the correct version.\n  ```\n  node -v\n  ```\n\n<img src=\"images/production/azure_terminal_2.png\" alt=\"Azure Instance Details\" />\n\n### Installing PM2\n\nPM2 is a tool for monitoring Node.js applications and restarting them if they crash. Install it as follows.\n\n```\nnpm i -g pm2\n```\n\nPM2 will be configured later.\n\n### Downloading the Application\n\nNow the actual application needs to be downloaded and the dependencies installed. The location of the where the code goes is not important, so I will be putting it in the `/home` directory of the primary admin user. For enhanced security, an `app` user could be created that only has the necessary permissions to run the application and nothing else, but is not covered here.\n\nIn the preferred directory to house the code, run the following command.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/duckies/omc-app.git app\n```\n\nThen navigate into the newly created folder.\n\n```\ncd app\n```\n\nRun the sequence of commands to install the dependencies in the `frontend` and `backend` folders.\n\n```\ncd backend\n```\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\n```\ncd ../frontend\n```\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Configuring the Application\n\nThe application requires 2 configuration files to be created in order to know how to operate. While we are in the frontend folder create a file called `.env`.\n\n```\ntouch .env\n```\n\nThen using your preferred editor, edit the file. I will be utilizing the terminal so I will quickly do this using nano, though utilizing a FTP program such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) and editing it with a text editor is also possible.\n\n```\nnano .env\n```\n\nUnless you are changing other defaults, which are discussed in the ***(TBA Configuration Explanation Page)***, the frontend needs to know how to connect to the backend API and what the domain is for the frontend.\n\n<alert type=\"warning\">\n\nIt is expected that the Orlando Math Circle application will be available at `app.orlandomathcircle.org` and the backend API at `api.orlandomathcircle.org`. However, for the tutorial I will be using a personal domain, `johng.dev` and the respective `app.johng.dev` and `api.johng.dev`. So replace the domain where appropriate.\n\n</alert>\n\nFill the contents of the `.env` file using your editor with the following:\n\n```env\nSTATIC_BASE=https://api.johng.dev\nAXIOS_BROWSER_BASE_URL=https://api.johng.dev\nPAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=<provided by PayPal>\n```\n\nNow navigate to the backend folder and start a new `.env` there as well.\n\n```\ncd ../backend\n```\n\n```\ntouch .env\n```\n\n```\nnano .env\n```\n\nFill the contents of tthe `.env` file using your editor with the following then save and close the file.\n\n```env\nSECRET=<random string with no spaces>\nFRONTEND_URL=https://app.johng.dev\nADMIN_EMAIL=<your email>\nSENDGRID_IN_DEV=true\nSENDGRID_API_KEY=\nSERVE_STATIC=true\nDATABASE_NAME=<as configured previously>\nDATABASE_HOST=<as given by Azure>\nDATABASE_USER=<as configured previously>\nDATABASE_PASS=<as configured previously>\nDATABASE_SSL=true\nPAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=<provided by PayPal>\nPAYPAL_SECRET_KEY=<provided by PayPal>\nTWITTER_KEY=<provided by Twitter>\nTWITTER_SECRET=<provided by Twitter>\n```\n\n<alert type=\"warning\">\n\nThe application will not accept real PayPal payments by default and requires `PAYPAL_SANDBOXED` to be set to `false` in the backend `.env` file. Ensure the app is tested thoroughly and working properly in a new deployment before turning this on.\n\nSendGrid will also not send emails unless `SENDGRID_IN_DEV` is set to `false`. When set to true, emails are printed to the console.\n\n</alert>\n\nRun the following command while in the `/backend` subdirectory to attempt to connect to the database and create all of the necessary tables.\n\n```\nnpx mikro-orm schema:create -r --fk-checks\n```\n\nIf an error appears, it will describe the nature of the connection problem, otherwise the database and tables are all setup.\n\nNow it should be possible to test that everything is working correctly by building and starting the backend. Run these commands in sequence in the `/backend` subdirectory and `Nest application successfully started` should appear.\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\n```\nnpm run start\n```\n\n<img src=\"images/production/setup_2.png\" />\n\n### Installing Nginx\n\nThe backend and frontend run by default on the local ports of 3000 and 8080 respectively. In order to expose those ports to the internet and map them to their respective domains NGINX provide a proxy for doing just that. Run the following commands to update the Ubuntu repositories and then install Nginx.\n\n```\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx\n```\n\nTest that Nginx is running by looking for `active (running)` after the following command. You can also visit the IP address of the virtual machine and you should see a `Welcome to nginx!` message.\n\n```\nsystemctl status nginx\n```\n\nNext we need to connect the virtual machine to the domains for the frontend and backend. In your domain registrar, add a new `A` record for the `app` and `api` subdomain both pointing to the IP of the virtual machine. Before continuing the DNS needs to propagate these changes, to ensure they are already propagated you may use the `dig api.<domain>` command to ensure the `A` record and IP address are listed correctly.\n\nOnce that is done, we need to tell Nginx about these two domains.\n\n```\nsudo touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.johng.dev\nsudo touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/app.johng.dev\n```\n\nThen we need to link these files from the available sites to the enabled sites.\n\n```\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.johng.dev /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/app.johng.dev /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n```\n\nWe now need to configure each server block.\n\n```\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.johng.dev\n```\n\nCopy the following information into the server block. Be sure to set the correct `server_name`.\n\n```\nserver {\n  listen 80;\n  listen [::]:80;\n  \n  server_name api.johng.dev;\n  \n  gzip            on;\n  gzip_types      text/plain application/xml text/css application/javascript;\n  gzip_min_length 1000;\n\n  location / {\n    expires $expires;\n\n    proxy_redirect                      off;\n    proxy_set_header Host               $host;\n    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;\n    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto  $scheme;\n    proxy_read_timeout                  1m;\n    proxy_connect_timeout               1m;\n    proxy_pass                          http://127.0.0.1:3000;\n  }\n\n  # Certbot renewal\n  location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {\n    alias /var/www/acme-challenge/;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen do the same for the other file.\n\n```\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/app.johng.dev\n```\n\n```\nmap $sent_http_content_type $expires {\n  \"text/html\" epoch;\n  \"text/html; charset=utf-8\" epoch;\n  default off;\n}\n\nserver {\n  listen 80;\n  listen [::]:80;\n  \n  server_name app.johng.dev;\n\n  gzip on;\n  gzip_types text/plain application/xml text/css application/javascript;\n  gzip_min_length 1000;\n\n  location / {\n    expires $expires;\n\n    proxy_redirect off;\n    proxy_set_header Host $host;\n    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    proxy_read_timeout 1m;\n    proxy_connect_timeout 1m;\n    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;\n  }\n\n  location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {\n    alias /var/www/acme-challenge/;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen we want to make sure that Nginx will accept the configuration. Run `sudo nginx -t` and make sure there are no errors. Nginx is particular about the format of the server block files.\n\nIf the configuration is valid we can reload Nginx. \n\n```\nsudo systemctl reload nginx\n```\n\nFrom here we want to setup LetsEncrypt to enable SSL.\n\n```\nsudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx\n```\n\nOnce that is installed we can run Certbot for both domains.\n\n```\nsudo certbot --nginx -d api.johng.dev -d app.johng.dev\n```\n\nIt will ask for some basic information and terms of service agreeances. However, if everything is successful it will complete the registraion for both domains. It will ask if you want to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS traffic, and we do, but we'll modify this ourselves so select option 1.\n\n<img src=\"images/production/setup_3.png\" />\n\nHere we will open both block files again and make some minor changes.\n\n```\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/api.johng.dev\n...\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/app.johng.dev\n```\n\nRemove the following lines from *both* files.\n\n```\n  listen 80;\n  listen [::]:80;\n```\n\nEnsure that the configuration is valid.\n\n```\nsudo nginx -t\n```\n\nRestart Nginx\n\n```\nsudo systemctl reload nginx\n```\n\nLetsEncrypt certificates only last 90 days or so, so we want to make sure the Certbot installed the services to auto-renew the certificate for us. Verify that the following service reports `active (waiting)`.\n\n```\nsudo systemctl status certbot.timer\n```\n\nAlso make sure the following dry-run of a Certbot renewal works correctly. This ensures our Nginx sites are configured properly.\n\n```\nsudo certbot renew --dry-run\n```\n\nWe can quickly test that everything is setup by starting the backend server and going to `https://api.johng.dev/`.\n\n```\ncd ~/app/backend # Or wherever it was installed\n```\n\n```\nnpm run start\n```\n\nThe following text should be displayed when visiting `https://api.johng.dev/` (or similar for your domain).\n\n```\n{\"statusCode\":404,\"message\":\"Cannot GET /\",\"error\":\"Not Found\"}\n```\n\nThis is a JSON API response, meaning the backend is successfully operational. Also ensure that the little lock icon by the address bar indicates a secure SSL connection. You should be able to now open a second terminal while the backend code is running and test that `https://app.johng.dev/` is working by starting the frontend.\n\n<alert type=\"warning\">\n\nThe frontend may take a considerable amount of time to build. So while it may appear to hang at times, it is still running.\n\n</alert>\n\n```\ncd ~/app/frontend\n```\n\n```\nnpm run build && npm run start\n```\n\n<img src=\"images/production/setup_4.png\" />\n\nNow visit `https://app.johng.dev` (`https://app.orlandomathcircle.org`) in the browser and it should show the app landing page. Also verify that the browser indicates the connection is secure.\n\n### Configuring PM2\n\nThe virtual machine can manage starting and restarting the frontend and backend on its own through the use of the PM2 Node.js library. From anywhere, we can install PM2 globally.\n\n```\nnpm install -g pm2\n```\n\nWe can now add the frontend and backend to be managed by PM2. Stop the currently running frontend and backend before running the next commands.\n\n```\ncd ~/app/backend && pm2 start npm --name \"backend\" -- start\ncd ~/app/frontend && pm2 start npm --name \"frontend\" -- start\n```\n\nPM2 will now ensure that the frontend and backend stay running and restart if they close for whatever reason. Logs for each can be viewed with `pm2 logs <name|id|all>`. However, PM2 will need to configure a startup script to handle the case when the virtual machine itself restarts or crashes and reboots.\n\n```\npm2 startup\n```\n\nIt will print out the command you need to copy and paste to enable the startup script. Run that command and you're done.\n\n### Final Steps\n\nThere are a couple remaining steps to setting up the application. By default the backend is expecting to host static files itself. Ideally this may be best handled by Nginx for caching reasons if the new team wishes to undertake this change. Files are not stored within the directory containing the application code as it's meant to be a volatile directory where changes to the code can mess with directories. Thus, by default the backend will create an `uploads` directory at the same level as the folder where the code is stored and we need to copy the default avatar images into there.\n\n```\ncp -R ~/app/images/defaults ~/uploads\n```\n\nLastly, in order to create an administrator account either a regular account can be made and the database modified to change a users roles to `{admin}`, or the `ADMIN_EMAIL` setting in the backend `.env` file is set so that a user registering with that exact email will be promoted to admin during registration.\n\nOnce an admin account exists, other admins
